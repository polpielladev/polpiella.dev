This is what you need to add to your workflows to cancel any ongoing workflows in the same concurrency group when a new one is triggered:

```yaml
name: Cancel in-progress workflows in the same concurrency group

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.head_ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
