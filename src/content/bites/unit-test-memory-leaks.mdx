This is how you can write a small utility method as an `XCTestCase` extension to ensure your objects are deallocated properly in your unit tests:

```swift
import XCTest

// 1
public extension XCTestCase {
  // 2
  func assertInstancesAreDeallocated(
    _ instances: [AnyObject],
    line: UInt = #line,
    file: StaticString = #file
  ) {
    // 3
    let instancesContainer = NSHashTable<AnyObject>.weakObjects()
    instances.forEach { instancesContainer.add($0) }

    // 4
    addTeardownBlock {
      instancesContainer.allObjects.forEach {
        XCTAssertNil($0, file: file, line: line)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step by step

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Define a new extension for `XCTestCase` with the right access control level that you can use directly from your unit test classes.
2. Define a method that takes in an array of `AnyObject` instances and two optional parameters: `line` and `file`. These parameters are used to show the failure message in the test's file and line rather than in the utility method.
3. Create an array with weak objects using `NSHashTable` to store the instances without keeping strong references to them as Swift arrays do.
4. Add a teardown block that runs after the test method has finished. When this block is executed, all instances defined in the test method should have been deallocated and, therefore, should be `nil`. If any of the instances are still alive, the test will fail indicating a memory leak has occurred.
