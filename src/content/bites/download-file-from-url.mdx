This is how you use `URLSession` to download a file from a URL in Swift:

```swift
import Foundation

// 1
func download(from url: URL, to location: URL) async throws {
    // 2
    let (tempLocation, downloadFileResponse) = try await URLSession.shared.download(from: url)
    // 3
    guard let httpResponse = downloadFileResponse as? HTTPURLResponse,
        httpResponse.statusCode == 200 else {
        return
    }

    // 4
    try FileManager.default
        .moveItem(
            at: tempLocation,
            to: location
        )
}
```

## Step by step

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Define an async throwing function that takes in a remote URL to download from and a local URL with the file location to save the file to.
2. Use `URLSession.shared.download(from:)` to download the file from the remote URL. This function returns a tuple with the temporary location of the downloaded file and the response from the server.
3. Check if the response is an HTTP response and if the status code is 200.
4. Move the downloaded file from the temporary location to the final location.
