First of all, I would like to start by **thanking you** for attending the workshop and for your interest in learning more about tooling, automation, CI/CD and how to **ship your apps faster with Xcode Cloud**.

It was great to meet you all and bounce ideas off each other during the workshop. I hope you enjoyed the content and that I somewhat managed to inspire you to build more automations and improve your workflows.

In this page, you will find useful resources to both **revisit the content** we covered during the workshop and to **expand on the topics** we discussed.

## Workflow 1: Changes to the main branch

The first workflow we built during the workshop was to run the unit tests on every push to the main branch, and on every pull request that had main as the base branch.

<Video name="xcode-cloud-workshop-changes-into-main.mp4" />

To increase the complexity, we implemented this workflow on an app that uses CocoaPods as a dependency manager and showed how to install the Pod dependencies with CI scripts.

First, we installed CocoaPods using ruby's bundler:

```bash:Terminal
bundle init
```

Then, we added the cocoapods gem to the Gemfile:

```ruby:Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "cocoapods"
```

At this point, we installed all Gems and created a CocoaPods project:

```bash:Terminal
bundle install

bundle exec pod init
```

We then added our first and only dependency for the project to the Podfile â€” the AppCenter SDK:

```ruby:Podfile
platform :macos, '14.0'

pod 'AppCenter'
```

We now needed to install the dependencies on the CI environment. We created a `ci_scripts/` directory and added a `ci_post_clone.sh` script that gets executed after the repository is cloned on the runner:

```bash:ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh
#!/bin/sh

cd ..

echo 'export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems' >>~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bash_profile
export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems
export PATH="$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH"

gem install bundler --install-dir $GEM_HOME

bundle install

bundle exec pod install
```

## Workflow 2: Nightly builds

In this part of the workshop, we built a scheduled workflow that would archive the application for internal testing and then distribute the resulting artifact to testers via TestFlight and AppCenter.

To showcase that we can use existing fastlane lanes in Xcode Cloud and to benefit from an existing plugin to upload to AppCenter, we started by adding the fastlane gem to the Gemfile:

```ruby:Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "cocoapods"
gem "fastlane"
gem "xcodeproj"

plugins_path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'fastlane', 'Pluginfile')
eval_gemfile(plugins_path) if File.exist?(plugins_path)
```

We then installed all dependencies, initialised the fastlane project and installed the fastlane plugin for AppCenter:

```bash:Terminal
bundle install
bundle exec fastlane init
bundle exec fastlane add_plugin appcenter
```

Now that the fastlane project was all set up, we created a lane that used the plugin to upload an artifact at the location provided by Xcode Cloud's environment variables to AppCenter:

```ruby:Fastfile
desc "Upload the built artifact to AppCenter"
lane :upload_to_appcenter do
  archive_path_dir = ENV["CI_ARCHIVE_PATH"]
  pkg_file = File.join(archive_path_dir, "Products", "Applications", "QReate.app")
  dsym_file = File.join(archive_path_dir, "dSYMs", "QReate.app.dSYM")

  appcenter_upload(
      api_token: ENV["APP_CENTER_API_KEY"],
      owner_name: "polpielladev",
      app_name: "QReate",
      release_notes: "Bug fixes and new features",
      file: pkg_file,
      dsym: dsym_file,
      notify_testers: false
  )
end
```

Finally, we just needed to run the fastlane lane after the archive step in the Xcode Cloud workflow:

```bash:ci_scripts/ci_post_xcodebuild.sh
#!/bin/sh

cd ..

echo 'export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems' >>~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bash_profile
export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems
export PATH="$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH"

if [ "$CI_WORKFLOW" == "Nightly" ] && [ "$CI_XCODEBUILD_ACTION" == "archive" ]; then
    bundle exec fastlane upload_to_appcenter
fi
```

Once all the ground-work was done, we created a workflow from Xcode's dashboard:

## Workflow 3: Releases

The last workflow we built during the workshop would run on every push to the `release/{platfom}` branch, archive the application and distribute it to testers on TestFlight for external testing.

The workflow would also set the app's version number to the one in the branch's name, using a Fastlane lane once again:

```ruby:Fastfile
fastlane_require 'xcodeproj'

desc "Updates the app's `MARKETING_VERSION` based on the branch name if needed."
lane :update_version_number_if_needed do
  split_git_ref = ENV["CI_BRANCH"].split("/", -1)

  if split_git_ref.length != 3
    UI.user_error!("Invalid branch name: #{ENV["CI_BRANCH"]}, expected format: release/{platform}/{version}")
  end

  version_number = split_git_ref.last
  platform = split_git_ref[1]
  set_all_xcodeproj_version_numbers(version_number, platform.downcase)

  if git_status(path: "QReate.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj").empty?
    puts "ðŸš€ Nothing to commit, pushing the same version again!"
  else
    sh("git fetch origin main:main")
    sh("git checkout main")

    git_commit(path: "QReate.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj", message: "[ðŸš€ release #{platform}] Updating version to: #{version_number}")

    # Push with personal access token to enable permissions in Xcode Cloud
    sh("git push https://polpielladev:#{ENV["GITHUB_TOKEN"]}@github.com/polpielladev/QRBuddy.git")
  end
end

def set_all_xcodeproj_version_numbers(version_number, platform)
  project = Xcodeproj::Project.open('../QReate.xcodeproj')
  targets = project.targets
  if platform == "macos"
    targets = targets.select { |target| target.name == "QReate" || target.name == "QReateSafariExtension" } 
  else
    UI.user_error!("Invalid platform: #{platform}, allowed values are: macos")
  end

  targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings["MARKETING_VERSION"] = version_number
    end
  end
  project.save
end
```

The lane above requires an extra plugin called `git_status`, so for it to work, we need to install the plugin:

```bash:Terminal
bundle exec fastlane add_plugin git_status
```

We can then modify the `ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh` script to run the Fastlane lane and set the version number:

```bash:ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh
#!/bin/sh

cd ..

echo 'export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems' >>~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bash_profile
export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems
export PATH="$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH"

gem install bundler --install-dir $GEM_HOME

bundle install

bundle exec pod install

if [ "$CI_WORKFLOW" == "Release macOS" ]; then
    bundle exec fastlane update_version_number_if_needed
fi
```

With this lane in place, we created a new workflow that would run on every push to the `release/macOS` branch:
