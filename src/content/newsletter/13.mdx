Hey everyone! üëã Welcome to the **thirteenth** issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. I hope you've all had a fantastic couple of weeks!

Conference season is fastly approaching and my effort has shifted to preparing for my upcoming talks. I am very excited to travel to new places, meet new people and learn from amazing speakers and attendees.

For this reason, I thought I would start this issue by asking you a question: **Which conferences will you be attending this year?** Let me know by replying to this email or reaching out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/polpielladev), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/polpielladev) or [Mastodon](https://iosdev.space/@polpielladev). üòä

## [üì¶ Automating Swift command line tool releases](https://www.polpiella.dev/automating-swift-package-releases-with-github-actions?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2013%26utm_content%3Dapr_09_23)

In this week's article in my blog, I wrote about the GitHub Actions workflow I wrote to release my command line [chatty](https://github.com/polpielladev/chatty-cli). The article goes through how to build a Swift CLI for multiple architectures, create a GitHub release and distribute the app using Homebrew.

## [‚úÇÔ∏è The impact of unoptimised images on an app's size](https://twitter.com/emergetools/status/1644026876053315584)

This week I came across another great Twitter thread by the team over at [Emerge Tools](https://twitter.com/emergetools). This time they share their analysis of the Chevrolet mobile app and how unoptimised images were bloating their app binary size unnecessarily.

## [‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping DocC and Xcode Cloud CI runs](https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1644656511317078017?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2013%26utm_content%3Dapr_09_23)

I have recently discovered that you can tell Xcode Cloud not to run for a specific commit by including \[ci skip\] in its title or description. When I shared this tip on Twitter, [Rudrank](https://twitter.com/rudrankriyam) also [pointed out that this principle also applies to DocC projects](https://twitter.com/rudrankriyam/status/1644656986229821440), looks like they both must be using the same system underneath ü§î.

## [ü§Ø Using the \-why_load linker flag to reduce app size](https://asifmohd.github.io/ios/2023/03/30/reducing-ios-app-size-using-linker.html?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2013%26utm_content%3Dapr_09_23)

This week I learnt thanks to [Asif](https://twitter.com/_asif0312)'s great post that you can find out specifically **why** each symbol is linked to your app's binary by using the `why_load` linker flag.

This has inspired me to look into how the results of this linker flag can be used in a scheduled CI workflow to report the most significant findings in an easily parsable format.

## [üíª Tartelet: An app to manage self-hosted ephemeral GitHub runners](https://shape.dk/news-and-knowledge/tartelet?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2013%26utm_content%3Dapr_09_23)

I recently came across a tweet from [Simon B. St√∏vring](https://twitter.com/simonbs)¬†announcing a macOS app that¬†[Shape](https://twitter.com/Shapedk) has open-sourced: [**Tartelet**](https://github.com/shapehq/tartelet/wiki/Installing-Tartelet). The app, which Shape has been using internally for the past few months,¬†allows its users to manage ephemeral self-hosted GitHub runners.
