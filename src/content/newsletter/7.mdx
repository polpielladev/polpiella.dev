HeyÂ everyone! ðŸ‘‹Â  Welcome to the seventh issue of the iOS CI Newsletter! Hope youâ€™ve all had an amazingÂ couple ofÂ weeks!

I am finally back in the groove of things after a long break during Christmas. I have been working hard on bringing out more articles about CI/CD on [my blog](https://www.polpiella.dev) recently so I would thoroughly recommend keeping an eye on it if you'd like to learn more about the topic!

I am also happy to share that I have ordered the first everÂ iOS CI Newsletter stickersÂ ðŸŽ‰Â I will be taking them with me to meetups and conferences this year, so make sure you come up to me and ask me for one when you see me!

## [Using App Store Connect API keys in Fastlane](https://www.polpiella.dev/fastlane-appstore-connect-api-and-github-actions)

In this week's article, I go through how to authenticate with the App Store Connect API using API keys directly from Fastlane. I decided to write a complete '*all you need to know'*Â guide on the topic which shows the whole process:Â **creating**Â an API key,Â **storing**Â it in the CI,Â **making**Â it available to the CI workflows, andÂ **using**Â it in Fastlane.

## [Stress testing iOS apps](https://testableapple.com/note-36/)

In this article,Â [Alexey Alter-Pesotskiy](https://twitter.com/testableapple)Â introduces his brand new command-line tool calledÂ **[xcmonkey](https://github.com/alteral/xcmonkey)**. This new tool allows you to **stress** test iOS apps to make sure they behave correctly when presented with a high load ofÂ user input (e.g. pressing or swiping repeatedly on a particular screen).

I can see this tool being very powerful when used in combination with other UI testsÂ on CI/CD workflows and I am very excited to try it outÂ ðŸŽ‰

## [Running audio/video UI tests on CI](https://www.kubilayerdogan.net/xctest-fixing-audio-video-ui-tests-on-your-ci-cd/)

I really enjoyed reading this article fromÂ [Kubilay Erdogan](https://twitter.com/kublaios)Â on how to run UI tests that **require audio output** in your CI provider. As [Kubilay](http://twitter.com/kublaios) explains in the article, CI providers use **virtual machines with no sound** and, if you want to test features that require sound output, there is some extra setup you need to do.

## [Testing Swift command-line tools](https://blog.eidinger.info/test-your-command-line-tool-in-xcode)

A bit of a blast from the past, but I still refer to this articleÂ from [Marco Eidinger](https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger) every time I have to make a **command-line tool**.

It is a short and straight-to-the-point guide on how to test Swift command-line toolsÂ directly from Xcode.

## [A talk on Xcode Cloud](https://twitter.com/nyswifty/status/1613491321213259776)

One of my goals for this year is to speak more about CI at conferences and share my experience on the topic. For the first time, I will be giving a talk on CI/CD at [NYSwifty](https://twitter.com/nyswifty), specifically on how to get started with [Xcode Cloud](https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/)Â ðŸŽ‰.

If you are based in or around New York, I would thoroughly recommend attending the conference in April, there are a lot of amazing speakersÂ confirmed already.Â If you can't attend, don't worry as all sessions will also be recorded ðŸ“¹Â ðŸŽ‰
