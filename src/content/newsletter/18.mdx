Hey everyone! üëã Welcome to the **eighteenth issue** of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope
you've had a great couple of weeks!

I have spent the past week trying out new features announced in WWDC such as **macros**, **Xcode Cloud and App Store Connect API advancements** and **Swift Data**.

I have to say that so far **I am very impressed**! It all looks very exciting and I can't wait to get the app at work building on Xcode 15. I think I will start looking into it next week and report my findings in the next issue of the newsletter, so keep your eyes peeled üëÄ.

‚ùì What about you? Have you already tried to build your app at work on Xcode 15? If so, what issues you have found?

## [üì¶ Try new SPM features with version-specific manifests](https://www.polpiella.dev/version-specific-package-manifests?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23)

Swift 5.9, which ships with the Xcode 15 betas announced at WWDC 2023, comes with new SPM features such as **macro targets** and **new permissions for command plugins**.

In this week's article on my blog, I show you how you can safely try these new features out **without breaking backward compatibility**.

## [üì¢ Mobile DevOps Summit is back!](https://blog-proxy.bitrise.io/post/bitrise-announces-mobile-devops-summit-2023?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23)

[Bitrise](https://twitter.com/bitrise) has recently announced that the Mobile DevOps Summit is retaking place this year on the **4th and 5th of October**.

I attended and spoke at last year's edition and I would thoroughly recommend it if you're interested in topics such as mobile CI/CD, automation and testing. You can register for the event [here](https://summit.bitrise.io?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23) and, if you have a topic in mind you'd like to speak about, [the Call For Papers is now open too](https://summit.bitrise.io/page/2783513/call-for-papers?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23)!

## [üëÄ Uploading link maps to Emerge](https://www.roger.ml/p/emerge-linkmaps?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23)

[Emerge](https://twitter.com/emergetools?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23) is an amazing service that can help you improve your app in a number of ways. You can do things such as seeing how much your **app size** has varied from one build to another or profile how long it takes for your app to **launch**.

Some of Emerge's more advanced features require you to upload linkmaps for your app. In this article, [Roger Oba](https://twitter.com/rogerluan_) shows you how you can generate these linkmaps using Fastlane and Xcode and upload them to Emerge.

## [üöÄ Understanding iOS CI/CD](https://tanaschita.com/20230529-continuous-integration-and-delivery-for-ios?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23)

This article by [Natascha Fadeeva](https://twitter.com/tanaschita) is an excellent resource if you want to **get started with CI/CD**. It goes through **what CI/CD is** and the core concepts behind it, **what role it plays in iOS app development** and some of the most common **CI/CD tools available**.

## [üì± Comparing build distribution services](https://www.runway.team/blog/comparing-the-top-pre-production-and-beta-app-distribution-tools?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23)

If you're an iOS developer you will have most likely used **TestFlight** to distribute builds of your app with testers but did you know there are other services available that might be a better match for your needs?

In this article, [Gabriel Savit](https://twitter.com/GabrielSavit) shares a great comparison of **build distribution systems available**, including one that [Runway](https://twitter.com/RunwayTeam) has recently launched ‚ú®.

## [‚úçÔ∏è Fastlane 2.213.0: Run Xcode 14.3 with Rosetta](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.213.0?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23)

Xcode 14.3 **dropped support for running Xcode with Rosetta** but there is still an option to run an app on **Rosetta simulators** (as [Sarun](https://twitter.com/sarunw) greatly explains [in this article](https://sarunw.com/posts/open-using-rosetta-in-xcode-14-3?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23)).

There was an issue where Fastlane would **not allow users to make use of this option** from the **scan** command but, as is usually the case, the amazing [Josh Holtz](https://twitter.com/joshdholtz) came up with a fix for it and shipped it in version **2.213.0**! ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you'd like to learn more about how this new **Fastlane flag** works or how you can achieve the same result using **xcodebuild** directly, I would thoroughly recommend reading [this article](https://www.roger.ml/p/run-xcodebuild-using-rosetta-xcode-14-3?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23) by [Roger Oba](https://twitter.com/rogerluan_).
