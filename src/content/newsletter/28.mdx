Hey everyone! üëã Welcome to the **twenty-eigth issue** of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you've had a great couple of weeks!

I am especially excited about this issue as it features a mixture of content from the community ranging from **amazing updates to open-source projects** to running Swift projects on **non-Apple platforms** like Windows or AWS amazonlinux runners!

I love how far Swift is going as a language and how much you can do with it these days! üéâ

## [üöÄ Making your Swift tools available on Windows](https://www.polpiella.dev/running-swift-on-widnows-with-gha)

Do you have a **Swift command-line tool** and want to make it available for **Windows** users? Well, you'll be happy to know that you don't have to rewrite your program in a different language or **even own a Windows machine** to do so!

As I show you in this article, all you need is a CI/CD pipeline capable of spinning up a Windows runner and installing a Swift toolchain on it!

## [üéâ Fastlane officially moves to the Mobile Native Foundation](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/discussions/discussions/194#discussioncomment-7406759)

We had an amazing update from [Paul Beusterien](https://twitter.com/paulbeusterien)¬†on the topic of moving [Fastlane](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools)'s ownership from Google, who weren't actively maintaining it, over to the [Mobile Native Foundation](https://twitter.com/mobilenativefdn).

This move is going to help [Fastlane](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools) massively and I want to give a massive shout-out to [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshdholtz), [Paul](https://twitter.com/paulbeusterien), [Keith](https://twitter.com/SmileyKeith) and everyone else involved for their work to make this happen ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## [‚≠êÔ∏è Stellar: The idea of Swift replacement for Fastlane](https://albertodebortoli.com/2023/10/29/the-idea-of-a-fastlane-replacement/)

While I love [Fastlane](http://twitter.com/FastlaneTools) and I use it extensively on **my day-to-day** both on work and personal projects, I am not the biggest fan of **ruby** (the language Fastlane is built on top of) and I prefer to use **Swift for tools** as much as possible.

So when [Alberto de Bortoli](https://twitter.com/albertodebo) told me about this idea he and some colleagues at [Just Eat](https://twitter.com/JET_technology) were exploring to build an alternative to Fastlane built exclusively in Swift, I thought it was very interesting. While they are not focusing on making the project ready for production at the moment, they have **open-sourced the code** for everyone to contribute and take a look üëÄ.

## [üö¥ Behind the scenes of the Glovo iOS app](https://tuist.io/blog/2023/11/03/glovo/)

As you might know from the last issue of the newsletter, I started working for [a Spanish company called Glovo](https://twitter.com/glovo) a couple of weeks ago and I was over the moon when I saw this interview with my colleague [David Cacenabes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cvdavid/?locale=en_US) on [Tuist](https://twitter.com/tuistio)'s blog.

In the interview, [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cvdavid/?locale=en_US) goes through how **modularity**, **efficient processes** and **tooling** are helping [Glovo](https://twitter.com/glovo) achieve their goals and ensure a great user experience.

## [üìπ \[NSLondon\] Serverless in Swift Like a Breeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4qSv_fhQIo&t=4s)

At this year's [SwiftLeeds conference](https://twitter.com/swift_leeds) and after a long time of following each other online, I finally met [Andrea Scuderi](https://twitter.com/andreascuderi13) in person for the first time and we had a great chat about **Swift**, **AWS** and **serverless computing**. I have been a fan of his project [Breeze](https://github.com/swift-sprinter/Breeze) for quite some time and it indeed makes **developing Swift AWS serverless APIs a lot simpler**!

During this talk at [NSLondon](https://twitter.com/NSLondonMeetup), he goes through how to use [Breeze](https://github.com/swift-sprinter/Breeze) to create serverless APIs using Swift and AWS üéâ
