HeyÂ everyone! ðŸ‘‹Â  Welcome to the tenth issue of the iOS CI Newsletter.Â Hope youâ€™ve all had a fantastic couple ofÂ weeks!

As I mentioned in the previous issue, we've had a two-week sprint at workÂ to look into how we can improve the state of ourÂ codebase. I have primarily focused on migratingÂ 3rd-party CocoaPods dependencies to Swift Package Manager and learning the ins and outs of how the Swift build system resolves, installs, and builds itsÂ dependencies, which has been very interesting.

This work inspired the article I wrote last week on my blogÂ which I am sharing in this issue of the newsletter ðŸŽ‰

## [Safely depending on exact versions of Swift Packages](https://www.polpiella.dev/safely-pinning-spm-depedencies-to-exact-versions?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23)

In this article, I explain why it might be a good idea to pinÂ Swift Package ManagerÂ dependencies to exactÂ versions and how setting an xcodebuild flag on your CI builds will help ensure you get reproducible builds andÂ mitigateÂ security risks.

## [ðŸš¨ You might need to update Fastlane ðŸš¨](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools/status/1629153901747265538?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23)

[Fastlane](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23) has hadÂ an issue this week affecting accounts that authenticateÂ with App Store Connect using Apple ID.Â This authentication method has beenÂ causing forbidden access responses that could even lock Apple ID accounts out ðŸ˜±.

Thankfully, [Josh Holtz](https://twitter.com/joshdholtz?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23) came to the rescue and swiftly opened aÂ [Pull Request](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/21073?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23) to fix theÂ issue, which was followed shortly after with [the release of version 2.212.1 of Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.212.1?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23)Â ðŸŽ‰.

If this is affectingÂ you and your team, make sure you update to the latest version now. As Fastlane themselves recommendÂ in [thisÂ tweet](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools/status/1629153901747265538?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23),Â consider [migratingÂ to using an App Store Connect API key as your authentication method going forward](https://www.polpiella.dev/fastlane-appstore-connect-api-and-github-actions?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23).

The team over at [Runway](https://twitter.com/RunwayTeam?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23) has launched a new product:Â [Quickstart CI/CD](https://www.runway.team/blog/introducing-quickstart-ci-cd-by-runway?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23). As its name states, this new tool allows you to createÂ new CI/CD pipelines for iOS and Android or replace existing flaky ones automatically with just a few clicks. And the best part is that **this new service is completely free**!Â ðŸŽ‰

As you will know by now, [Runway](http://twitter.com/RunwayTeam?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23) sponsor this newsletter, and when they shared the news of this new service and asked me whether I wanted to feature it, I immediately said yes as it looks very exciting! Hoping to try it out on a new side project soon ðŸ”¨ðŸ‘€

## [Fastlane might be moving to Mobile Native Foundation!](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/discussions/discussions/194?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23)

There has been a big conversation on Twitter this week about Fastlane and whether it should continue being owned by Google, who don't seem to be veryÂ invested in helping to maintain the tool.

[This thread](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1627315332716150785?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23), created by [Peter Steinberger](https://twitter.com/steipete?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23), started a great conversation about how Fastlane would benefit from moving to the [MobileÂ NativeÂ Foundation](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23).Â ThereÂ have already been conversations off the back of the thread on making this happen along with companies wanting to sponsor the Open Source project if thisÂ migration happens.Â ðŸŽ‰

If you're interested in keeping an eye on the move, [the conversation is happening in this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/discussions/discussions/194?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&utm_content=feb_26_23).
