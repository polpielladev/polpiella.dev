HeyÂ everyone! ðŸ‘‹Â  Welcome to the eighthÂ issue of the iOS CI Newsletter.Â Hope youâ€™ve all had an amazingÂ couple ofÂ weeks!

I am very happy to announce that, from this week, the awesome people atÂ [Runway](https://get.runway.team/get-started?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23) will be sponsoring the iOS CI Newsletter.

Getting a product that I personally like and with deep connections to the mobile CI/CD communityÂ to help me continue creating free contentÂ was one of my goals for the year, so I am very grateful to [Runway](https://get.runway.team/get-started?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23)Â for helping me achieve thisÂ ðŸŽ‰.

## [Scheduling tweets using GitHub Actions](https://www.polpiella.dev/scheduling-tweets-with-github-actions-and-swift?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23)

This week I wrote an article onÂ how I use GitHub Actions to automate repetitive processes such as posting content on Twitter. This is a slightly less common way of using GitHub Actions but, since minutes are free for public repositories, it can be a great option for automating repetitive tasks.

The commandÂ line at the heart of this scheduled task, which runs every Friday at noon, is written entirely in Swift.

## [Saving money when using GitHub Actions](https://blog.eidinger.info/save-money-when-using-github-actions-for-ios-cicd?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23)

One of the most important things to consider when choosing a CI provider is pricing. In this article, [Marco Eidinger](https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger) gives you a number of tips to keep your GitHub Actions bills as low as possible, or even free! ðŸ’°

## [iOS stress testing now from Fastlane](https://twitter.com/testableapple/status/1616522116517560322?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23)

I posted about [xcmonkey](https://github.com/alteral/xcmonkey), a toolÂ made by [Alexey Alter-Pesotskiy](https://twitter.com/testableapple)Â that allows you to stress test iOS apps from the command line, in the last issue of the newsletter. Since then, a new release with a Fastlane integrationÂ has come out, making stress testing your app on the CI a breeze.

## [Automated SwiftUI snapshot testing](https://twitter.com/emergetools/status/1615786030627704832?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23)

[Emerge Tools](https://twitter.com/emergetools)Â are looking for SwiftUI developers to trial a new service that automates snapshot testing without havingÂ to write any code.Â From reading the thread, it looks like this new tool will generate SwiftUI previews and compare them against a running app, which sounds very interesting.

If you or the company you work for have an app written in SwiftUI I would thoroughly recommend reaching out toÂ [Emerge Tools](https://twitter.com/emergetools)Â on TwitterÂ and asking for early access.

## [Swift package resolution and data usage](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2023/01/xcode-requires-data-connection-for-swift-package-resolution/?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23)

I have definitely experienced the pain of theÂ 'Resolve Packages' step in Xcode failing when using a weakÂ internet connection.Â [Christian Tietze](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2023/01/xcode-requires-data-connection-for-swift-package-resolution/)Â came across this same issue recently and decided to monitor how much data was being requested by Xcode.Â HeÂ noticed that a single resolution step downloadedÂ 45 MB of data! ðŸ˜±

This highlights a potential improvement you could do to reduce your CI's run times and network usage byÂ storing Swift Package caches on your runners or evenÂ [using binary targets instead to reduce dependency sizes](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/binary-targets-swift-package-manager/), as [Antoine](https://twitter.com/twannl) explains in his blog.
