Hey everyone! üëã Welcome to the **twenty-seventh issue** of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you've had a great couple of weeks!

This is the first issue I am **sending from Spain**, which is my new home as of last week. My partner and I made the decision to relocate to Spain after nine wonderful years in the UK, which meant that I had to **leave my role at the BBC** where I have learnt a lot and grown as an engineer and move on to a new adventure as an **iOS developer at [Glovo](https://glovoapp.com?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23)**.

I started the new job a few days ago and I will be working from their Barcelona offices, which I am super excited about. Alongside my day-to-day product work, I am also looking forward to making a positive impact and bringing my expertise to the table in the **CI/CD domain**.

If you are based in Barcelona, give me a shout and we'll meet up for a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è. Now, let's get into it and see what's new in the iOS CI world!

## [üí° Adding an Info.plist file to a Swift executable](https://www.polpiella.dev/info-plist-swift-cli?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23)

I have recently discovered that you can **add information such as a bundle identifier** to a Swift command-line tool using an `Info.plist` file. The best thing is that you can do so by adding a section to the executable so that you can still ship it **as a single file**!

The process is fairly simple and works for both **Swift Package** and **Xcode project** executable targets.

## [‚ö†Ô∏è Xcode 15.0.1 still suffers from test performance](https://twitter.com/Dimillian/status/1714907618706170230?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23)

Earlier this week I came across this tweet from [Thomas Ricouard](https://twitter.com/Dimillian) where he shared that, despite Apple's 15.0.1 bug fix release to address the slow first runs of test suites, **the issue was still apparent**.

After reading the replies, it seems that some users are [no longer experiencing freezes and hangs but rather the tests now seem to run 2x slower than they used to do on Xcode 14](https://twitter.com/NachoSoto/status/1715031262589780323) üò±.

## [ü™† Automated memory leak detection on CI/CD](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/automating-memory-leak-detection-with-ci-integration-for-ios-380f08a55f0b?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23)

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this article by [Tuan Hoang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuan-hoang-b02025183) where he explains the **difference between memory leaks and retain cycles** and how tricky it is sometimes to identify leaks, even when using the memory debugger in Xcode.

What I love about this article is that [Tuan Hoang](http://www.linkedin.com/in/tuan-hoang-b02025183) went ahead and came up with an **automation process** that uses UI tests, Apple's leaks tool and a custom script that parses memgraphs to detect memory leaks ü§Ø.

## [üîê 1Password + CI/CD](https://blog.1password.com/1password-service-accounts?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23)

While this post is from earlier in the year, I only discovered that you can retrieve secrets from [1Password](https://twitter.com/1Password) directly from your CI/CD workflows last week. I have been a [1Password](https://twitter.com/1Password) user for a long time and I can't wait to try this out!

The amazing article by [Michael Carey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-j-carey/) shows an example of how to use the feature in GitHub Actions, but there are many providers supported. If you'd like to see an example using [Codemagic](https://twitter.com/codemagicio), check out this great article by [Himesh Panchal](https://twitter.com/himesh_p).

## [üìπ \[NSSpain\] Why CI/CD won't save your mobile team](https://vimeo.com/865678854?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23)

I enjoyed watching the video for [Gabriel Savit](https://twitter.com/GabrielSavit)'s talk at [NSSpain](https://twitter.com/NSSpain), where he goes through **numerous aviation-themed automation examples** and how **they apply to mobile teams**.

While CI/CD is a key factor to ensuring your team's success, **it won't be enough on its own**. There are several **other processes** and **automations** that need to be considered as [Gabriel](https://twitter.com/GabrielSavit) explains in his talk üëç.
