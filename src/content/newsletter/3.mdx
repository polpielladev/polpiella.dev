Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹Â  Welcome to the thirdÂ issue of the iOS CI Newsletter! Hope youâ€™ve all had an amazingÂ couple ofÂ weeks!

November has been an amazing month for me, as the response to the previousÂ newsletters has been great andÂ I haveÂ had the chance to speak at [Do iOS in Amsterdam](https://do-ios.com),Â the [Mobile Devops Summit](https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit), andÂ the [Latin America Remote Job Fair](https://www.codementor.io/events/exploring-the-power-of-swift-beyond-app-development-fprz1hw3tl?ref=arc-sourcers) organised by [Arc](https://arc.dev).Â I want to take this chance to thank everyone involved and say hi to all the lovely people I have met at these three events, it has been a blast!

On the flip side, it has also been aÂ stressful month as earlier in November it was announced that [Revue](https://getrevue.co), the service that powered this newsletter, will be shutting downÂ by the end of this year. This meant that I had to migrate all subscribers and issues over to a new provider. I believe it is all set up correctly now,Â but if you spot any issues or have any feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know.

### [Binary Targets in Swift Package Manager](https://www.avanderlee.com/optimization/binary-targets-swift-package-manager/)

In this article, [Antoine](https://twitter.com/twannl) gives usÂ an insight intoÂ how binary targets work and specifically how they can come in very handy to improve your CI's performance as well as help reduceÂ its cache size.

I also had a conversation with [Antoine](https://twitter.com/twannl) and [Tim](https://twitter.com/0xTim)Â at [Do iOS](https://do-ios.com) about how long it took to build and run [swift-danger](https://github.com/danger/swift)Â as a Swift package on our respectiveÂ CIsÂ and [how pre-building it asÂ a binary can certainly help improve performance](https://github.com/danger/swift/issues/476#issue-1024788573).

### [Gaining confidence in your release process](https://www.polpiella.dev/testing-your-release-pipeline-using-fastlane)

Some processes, such as release pipelines, are veryÂ important but do not get run frequently, which can diminishÂ our confidence inÂ them.Â In this article, IÂ go through howÂ scheduled CI runs can help you spotÂ failures early and gain confidence in such processes.

### [How Xcode 14 can increase your app size](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/how-xcode14-unintentionally-increases-app-size)

Turns out that, as [Max Topolsky](https://twitter.com/mptop27)Â and [Josh Cohenzadeh](https://twitter.com/jshchnz)Â describe in full detail in this article, some apps packaged using Xcode 14 have seenÂ an increase in size due to binary symbols not being stripped. If you've encountered thisÂ do notÂ worryÂ because this article gives you a way to strip these binary symbols.

If you want to go further, you might consider adding some metrics to your CI to track the size of your application over time as these fluctuationsÂ can be otherwise easy to miss. [SwiftInfo](https://github.com/rockbruno/SwiftInfo/blob/master/Sources/SwiftInfoCore/Providers/IPASizeProvider.swift) by [Bruno Rocha](https://twitter.com/rockbruno_) is a perfect example of how this can be achieved (plus it's written entirely in Swift, which is always aÂ bonusðŸŽ‰).

### [Assets and application size](https://sowenjub.me/writes/how-i-made-my-app-73-percent-ligther/)

FollowingÂ the trend of app sizes, I really enjoyed reading this article by [Arnoud Joubay](https://twitter.com/sowenjub). ItÂ goes into great detail about things you need to be aware of when sharing assets between anÂ app and its extensions and how these might unnecessarily increaseÂ the size of your application.

### [Fixing code signing issues on Xcode 14](https://blog.codemagic.io/code-signing-issues-in-xcode-14-and-how-to-fix-them/)

If you have not yet migrated your CI to Xcode 14, [Rudrank](https://twitter.com/rudrankriyam)Â has your back andÂ will save you some time investigating the numerous code-signing issues you're likely to encounter.

### [Making App Store Connect better](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/crappstoreconnect2.html)

Letâ€™s finish up with a meme I took from aÂ postÂ by [Jeff Johnson](https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware) on how the App Store Connect login flow and remember me function does not work as expected. To make the login flow slightly better (or restore the way login used to be in ASC)Â [Jeff](https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware) has made [a pretty neat browser extension](https://github.com/lapcat/AppStoreConnect)Â that is completely open source.
