Hey everyone! üëã Welcome to the **WWDC special** issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. I hope you've all enjoyed Apple's Developer Conference and are looking forward to trying out all the **new features and APIs**.

In this special edition of the newsletter, I will be sharing my favourite WWDC sessions on CI/CD and developer tooling along with some great content from the community.

The main CI/CD highlight of this year's edition of Apple's Developer Conference for me is the fact that **Xcode Cloud** now allows you to automatically set **TestFlight test notes for beta builds**. This is a feature I have long been waiting for, and I got so excited when it was announced that I had to try it out and **write an article on the topic**!

I am also very excited to dive into **Swift macros**, **visionOS**, the exciting **mergeable libraries** and all of the **UIKit** and **SwiftUI** improvements!

‚ùìWhat's your WWDC highlight? Reach out to me on Twitter or reply to this email with what you're most excited about.

As I said in the introduction, the ability to set **test notes directly on Xcode Cloud builds** is a feature I have long been waiting for.

If you want to learn how to **automatically generate, translate and set test notes** on Xcode Cloud beta builds this is the article for you üí™.

Understanding the pros and cons of **static** and **dynamic** libraries is important for making informed decisions on how to link libraries in your application. Choosing one or the other might have an impact on things such as your **app's size** or **launch time**.
