_Let's rest and plan for the new year!_

Friday was my last day of work for the year as I decided to book next week and the few days between Christmas and New Year off.

This year has been great professionally but it has also been **very stressful** and **overwhelming** at times.

Between speaking at **several conferences**, keeping up with **weekly articles** and **fortnightly newsletter issues**, a **full-time job**, a **country move** and starting a **new role**, I haven't had a single week off where I could fully disconnect from everything.

I love what I do so I sometimes feel guilty expressing how stressed I sometimes get, but I was very relieved [Dave Verwer](https://twitter.com/daveverwer) also spoke about this in the [latest issue of iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/640#start). It was a read I really needed as I could relate with everything Dave was saying and I was inspired to tell my own story too! üéâ

On top of this, this year has been the hardest of my life personally and everything combined has made me take some **much-needed rest** to recharge batteries for the new year.

Having said this, **worry not** as there will still be articles over the next two weeks on my blog and a newsletter issue on the 31st, but I will finish getting them all ready tomorrow so I can relax for the whole Christmas break! üéÖüéÑ

## [‚òÅÔ∏è 25 hours of Xcode Cloud now included with the Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ik9z4ll6)

Xcode Cloud's free tier of **25 compute hours per month**, which was scheduled to disappear in January 2024, will now be **included** with the Apple Developer Program membership¬†üéâ.

## [‚öôÔ∏è Configure your GitHub repositories using yaml files](https://www.roger.ml/p/syncing-github-repository-settings?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2031%26utm_content%3Ddec_17_23)

In this article, [Roger Oba](https://twitter.com/rogerluan_)¬†goes through how you can configure GitHub repositories **using yaml config files**. This is a great way to **sync settings across multiple repositories** and streamline the **creation** and **configuration** of new ones.

I had no idea you could do this and will be using it from now on ü§Ø.

## [üì¶ Distributing Swift macros using CocoaPods](https://www.polpiella.dev/cocoapods-swift-macros?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2031%26utm_content%3Ddec_17_23)

I have recently been digging into the **build side of Swift macros** and how they can be distributed and imported without using Swift Package Manager.

In this week's article on my blog, I go through how you can leverage binaries to **distribute** and **import** a Swift macro using [CocoaPods](https://twitter.com/CocoaPods).

## [üéÖ Get your releases ready for Christmas!](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=uijoypq9)

As the festive time of the year approaches again, I would like to remind you that, while **Apple still accepts app submissions**, they say that reviews **may take a bit longer** to complete from **December 22nd to December 27th**.

For this reason, I would recommend you to plan accordingly if there is something big you'd like to release before the end of the year!

## [üöÄ A new version of the artifacts action is out!](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-12-14-github-actions-artifacts-v4-is-now-generally-available?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2031%26utm_content%3Ddec_17_23)

GitHub announced a couple of days ago that a new version (**v4**) of the first-party¬†[actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)¬†and¬†[actions/download-artifact](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact)¬†actions is available.

‚ö†Ô∏è While this release includes **some performance improvements**, it also **includes some breaking changes** so I would thoroughly encourage you [to read the full release notes](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/blob/main/README.md#v4---whats-new)¬†before going through with the update!

## [‚ú® Using Emerge Tools on CI/CD to optimise your app's size](https://blog.codemagic.io/optimising-ios-app-size-emerge-tools-ci-cd?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2031%26utm_content%3Ddec_17_23)

If you have been a subscriber of this newsletter for some time now you will know that I am a big fan of the work that the people at [Emerge Tools](https://twitter.com/emergetools) are doing and how their tools¬†help optimise mobile applications.

In this article in the [Codemagic](https://twitter.com/codemagicio) blog, [Himesh Panchal](https://twitter.com/himesh_p) goes through how you can set up and run [Emerge Tools](http://twitter.com/emergetools)' checks on a CI/CD workflow.
