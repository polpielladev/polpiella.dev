Hey everyone! üëã Welcome to the **nineteenth issue** of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you've had a great couple of weeks!

This week I want to start the issue by talking about a topic I am passionate about and that I have been advocating for over the past few years: **writing developer tools with Swift**.

If you have a project that is used, built and maintained by Swift developers, it makes a lot of sense to write any accompanying tooling using Swift too. Doing so can have several benefits such as:

1\. Making the tooling **easier to maintain over time** as it is written in a language you and your team are familiar with.

2\. If your project is Open Source, it will make it **easier to find contributors** that can help maintain the tooling as it is written in the **same language as the project itself**.

3\. Explaining how the tooling works to **new members of the team is a lot easier** as they are **familiar** with the language it is written in.

Furthermore, the introduction of Swift Packages and Open Source projects such as [Apple's Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23), as well as the [rapid growth of Swift on the server](https://www.areweserveryet.org?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23), has made **full-stack systems and tools to accompany your apps so much easier**!

There are some big companies out there that already take advantage of writing their tools with Swift. For example, my team at the **BBC** has a couple of scripts and command line tools that we use daily that are written entirely with Swift. Also, from speaking with [Alberto de Bortoli](https://twitter.com/albertodebo?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23), the Principal Software Engineer at **Just Eat Takeaway**, [it looks like they write most of their tooling with Swift too](https://twitter.com/albertodebo/status/1673802337175912449?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23)!

## [üß∞ Understanding mergeable libraries](https://www.polpiella.dev/understanding-mergeable-libraries?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23)

A couple of weeks ago I wrote about a brand new feature announced in WWDC23: **mergeable libraries**.

In the article, I show you how mergeable libraries work and how a couple of simple build settings changes can dramatically improve the **dependency graph of a modular codebase** üëÄ.

## [üì¶ This GitHub Action helps you keep SPM dependencies up to date!](https://github.com/MarcoEidinger/swift-package-dependencies-check?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23)

This week I came across this great GitHub Action by [Marco Eidinger](https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23) which processes your Swift Package's manifest to detect out-of-date dependencies.

The action is **highly configurable** and you can make it **fail the workflow run** if outdated dependencies are detected or even **automatically update such dependencies** for you.

## [ü§© Ready to use build utilities for your Swift scripts](https://github.com/onmyway133/Swiftlane?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23)

I recently learnt about a pretty cool open-source project called **SwiftLane**. **SwiftLane**, created and maintained by [Khoa](https://twitter.com/onmyway133?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23), is a collection of **ready-to-use build utilities** written entirely in Swift.

You can import SwiftLane as a Swift Package and use it directly in your **Swift scripts** and **CLIs** to perform common actions such as **building or archiving an Xcode project**, **communicating with App Store Connect** or **sending Slack messages**.

## [üî® Modifying Xcode project files programmatically](https://testableapple.com/managing-xcode-project-files-programmatically?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23)

In this article, [Alexey Alter-Pesotskiy](https://twitter.com/testableapple?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23) shows you how to manage and modify .xcodeproj files programmatically using a ruby gem called xcodeproj. This can come in very handy to apply patches and update build settings from scripts and tools.

As [Alexey](http://twitter.com/testableapple?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23) also points out in the article, if you write your scripts and command-line tools in Swift you must know that [Tuist](https://twitter.com/tuistio?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23), a popular tool created by [Pedro Pi√±era](https://twitter.com/pepicrft?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23) to automate and manage Xcode projects, [have created a Swift version of Xcodeproj](https://github.com/tuist/XcodeProj?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23) üéâ.

In this article, they explain the process of migrating **from a CocoaPods-based project to an SPM one** and share some of the challenges they have faced along the way. They also include a section on how they **leverage the power of CI/CD to automate their signing and distribution process** ‚ù§Ô∏è!
