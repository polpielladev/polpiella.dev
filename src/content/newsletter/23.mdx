Hey everyone! üëã Welcome to the **twenty-third issue** of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you've had a great couple of weeks!

I am very excited to announce that I have recently launched a brand new macOS app called [QReate](https://www.getqreate.app) that allows you to generate fully customisable QR codes to help you showcase your work.

As it couldn't be any other way the deployment process is fully automated using Xcode Cloud, which has helped me save a lot of time and effort when releasing new versions of the app.

I have shared extensive content about my experience using Xcode Cloud (TLDR; I am a big fan ‚ù§Ô∏è) so if you're interested in learning more about it, check out these free resources I have created:

## [üíÄ Finding dead code in your app with Reaper](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/dead-code-detection-with-reaper?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2023%26utm_content%3Daug_27_23)

[Emerge Tools](https://twitter.com/emergetools) have recently launched another great framework called [Reaper](https://docs.emergetools.com/docs/reaper) that helps you identify dead code in your application and remove it. What's cool about this new framework is that it doesn't just do a static analysis of your code but instead detects unused code at runtime.

If you want to find out more about how it works and how you can try the beta version out, check out this article by [Noah Martin](https://twitter.com/sond813).

## [üß™ Unit testing Tuist projects on CI/CD](https://ronanociosoig.medium.com/tuist-your-circle-putting-it-to-the-test-part-1-8dc168aefe7a?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2023%26utm_content%3Daug_27_23)

I met [Ronan](https://twitter.com/ronanoc) at NSBarcelona a few months ago and we had a great chat about Tuist, CI/CD and unit testing. He told me he was in the process of writing a blog post on the topic and I was super happy to see it published this week! üéâ

If you use Tuist, make sure you check this article out!

## [üñ•Ô∏è Migrating to self-hosted M1 Mac runners](https://medium.com/whatnot-engineering/migrating-ios-github-actions-to-self-hosted-m1-macs-runners-f75fbb00ab1b?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2023%26utm_content%3Daug_27_23)

If you use the GitHub Actions default macOS runners for your CI/CD, you will notice that they can be quite slow and expensive to run. For this reason, many teams have started migrating to self-hosted runners to save money and time.

This is exactly what the team at [Whatnot](https://twitter.com/Whatnot) did and one of their engineers, [Adrian ≈öliwa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sliwaadrian), wrote a great article about the process and how migrating to self-hosted EC2 macOS instances helped them save around $5,000 per month! ü§Ø

## [üö® CircleCI + chruby breaking changes](https://twitter.com/rogerluan_/status/1692157463426937048?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2023%26utm_content%3Daug_27_23)

A couple of weeks ago I came across this thread on Twitter where [Roger Oba](https://twitter.com/rogerluan_), one of [Fastlane's](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools) contributors, explained why [Fastlane's](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools) CircleCI workflows suddenly stopped working.

If you're a CircleCI and your workflows have recently started failing, make sure you check this thread out!

## [üîç How do symbols affect app size?](https://mfaani.com/posts/devtools/optimizing-app-size/how-can-i-inspect-the-size-impact-of-symbols-in-an-app-binary?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2023%26utm_content%3Daug_27_23)

I learnt a lot about the `nm` command from this article by [Mohammad Faani](https://twitter.com/mfaani) and how to use it to inspect the size impact of symbols in an app's binary.

If you're interested in learning more about the changes you can make to reduce your app's size, make sure you check this article out!

Are you and your team struggling with slow build times? If you are, you should check out this article by [Manu Herrera](https://twitter.com/manuherrera1) where he goes through how you can identify what's slowing your compile times down and also gives you plenty of tips on how to make your builds faster!
