Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the **twentieth issue** of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you've had a great couple of weeks!

I will keep my intro short and sweet this time as my focus these past two weeks hasn't been as much on CI/CD and automation as it usually is.

I have been doing a lot of SwiftUI both at work and for my side projects. I have been playing with [the new iOS 17+ MapKit and SwiftUI APIs](https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1675882601263820802), which are amazing, building a reusable settings form component to build data-backed screens from scratch at work and, of course, [looking into workarounds for the quirks and inconsistencies across SwiftUI in different iOS versions](https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1679808155092496385) 😅.

I am planning on writing some interesting articles about the things that I have been building over the next few weeks on my blog, so make sure to keep an eye on that if you're interested in finding out more! 👀

## [☁️ Xcode Cloud: Using swift packages that require authentication](https://blog.eidinger.info/using-swift-packages-with-authentication-in-xcode-cloud?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2020%26utm_content%3Djuly_16_23)

In this article, [Marco Eidinger](https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger) shows us how to use a `netrc` file in Xcode Cloud runners to **store credentials** that can then be used by SPM to download **private or internal binary releases**.

Marco also wrote [an article last year](https://blog.eidinger.info/xcode-133-supports-spm-binary-dependency-in-private-github-release?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2020%26utm_content%3Djuly_16_23) about solving the same problem in **GitHub Actions workflows**, which you might find useful too 🎉.

## [💻 Connect to your EC2 instances from the CLI](https://albertodebortoli.com/2023/07/05/easy-connection-to-aws-mac-instances-with-ec2macconnector?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2020%26utm_content%3Djuly_16_23)

[Alberto de Bortoli](https://twitter.com/albertodebo) has recently open-sourced [EC2macConnector](https://github.com/albertodebortoli/EC2macConnector), a command-line tool developed in Swift that simplifies the process of connecting to **Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 Mac** instances through SSH.

In this article, Alberto explains how [EC2macConnector](https://github.com/albertodebortoli/EC2macConnector) works and why you should start using it to access your EC2 instances! 🎉

## [🧰 SDKs and Xcode's version management](https://alexanderweiss.dev/blog/2023-07-04-appstore-connect-manage-app-version-and-build-number?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2020%26utm_content%3Djuly_16_23)

In this article, [Alexander Weiß](https://twitter.com/_al_we) explains how the _Manage version and build number_ Xcode setting can affect the version of the SDKs an app is using.

[Alexander](http://twitter.com/_al_we) also shows how you can turn the setting off both through Xcode's UI and programmatically to work around this issue 👏.

## [🚀 New Fastlane version](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.214.0)

[Fastlane](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools) 2.214.0 is out now and it comes packed with improvements and fixes to existing actions and lanes.

Among the changes, I would like to [highlight this PR](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/20956) by [Vitalii Budnik](https://twitter.com/iNekrich), which adds the ability to change an App Store Connect's user's role and permissions directly from Fastlane 🎉.
