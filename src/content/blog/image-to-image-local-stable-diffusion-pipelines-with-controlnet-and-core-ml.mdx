A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article about how to load Stable Diffusion models in Swift and generate images from text prompts.

In this article, I want to take it a step further and show you how you can use the same models in Swift and modify existing images with artificial intelligence and text prompts.

On top of this, I will also show you how you can use pre-trained ControlNet models to provide specific constraints over the modifications to the original images.
