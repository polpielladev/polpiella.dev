A couple of months ago, [Stuart Montgomery](https://twitter.com/throwspace), a software engineer in the `XCTest` team at Apple, shared a new macro-based open-source Swift testing library.

The library is called [swift-testing](https://github.com/apple/swift-testing) and, [as its documentation states](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-testing/main/documentation/testing) it is meant to be a proof of concept for a new testing API for Swift that is based on macros and that is integrated into Swift the same way that `XCTest` is.

For this reason, the library is meant to be **short-lived** and it is **not meant to be used in production** or migrated to from `XCTest`. However, it is a great way to get a glimpse of what the **future of testing** in Swift might look like, which is exactly what I did this week!

## Getting started

The first thing I did was to create a small Swift package that would allow me to write some tests using the new library:

```swift:Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "SwiftTestingDemo",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "SwiftTestingDemo",
            targets: ["SwiftTestingDemo"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "SwiftTestingDemo",
            swiftSettings: [
                .enableUpcomingFeature("BareSlashRegexLiterals")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

I then added some code that I had from my app [QReate](https://www.getqreate.app) which decodes WIFI URL strings into Swift structs, which I thought would be an ideal candidate to try `swift-testing` on:

```swift:WifiParser.swift
import Foundation

struct WifiNetwork {
    let ssid: String
    let password: String
    let security: String?
    let hidden: String?
}

protocol ErrorMonitoring {
    func monitor(_ error: Error)
}

struct WifiParser {
    enum Error: Swift.Error {
        case noMatches
    }

    private let monitoring: ErrorMonitoring

    init(monitoring: ErrorMonitoring) {
        self.monitoring = monitoring
    }

    func parse(wifi: String) throws -> WifiNetwork {
        let regex = /WIFI:S:(?<ssid>[^;]+);(?:T:(?<security>[^;]*);)?P:(?<password>[^;]+);(?:H:(?<hidden>[^;]*);)?;/

        guard let result = try? regex.wholeMatch(in: wifi) else {
            let error = Error.noMatches
            monitoring.monitor(error)
            throw error
        }

        return WifiNetwork(
            ssid: String(result.ssid),
            password: String(result.password),
            security: result.security.map(String.init),
            hidden: result.hidden.map(String.init)
        )
    }
}
```

## Setting up swift-testing

Now that I had code to test, I went ahead and set up the test target to be able to start using `swift-testing`.

### Depending on swift-testing

The first thing I had to do was add `swift-testing` as a dependency to both the package and the test target:

```swift:Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "SwiftTestingDemo",
    platforms: [
        .macOS(.v13), .iOS(.v16), .watchOS(.v9), .tvOS(.v16), .visionOS(.v1)
    ],
    products: [
        // Products define the executables and libraries a package produces, making them visible to other packages.
        .library(
            name: "SwiftTestingDemo",
            targets: ["SwiftTestingDemo"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-testing.git", branch: "main"),
    ],
    targets: [
        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package, defining a module or a test suite.
        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package and products from dependencies.
        .target(
            name: "SwiftTestingDemo",
            swiftSettings: [
                .enableUpcomingFeature("BareSlashRegexLiterals")
            ]
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "SwiftTestingDemoTests",
            dependencies: ["SwiftTestingDemo", .product(name: "Testing", package: "swift-testing")]),
    ]
)
```

### Running all tests

Due to the way that tests are organised in swift-testing and the fact that it is not integrated into Xcode or SPM yet, you need to create a small `XCTestCase` subclass that creates a single test method that finds and runs all tests using `XCTestScaffold`:

```swift:TestScaffold.swift
import XCTest

final class AllTests: XCTestCase {
    func testAll() async {
        await XCTestScaffold.runAllTests(hostedBy: self)
    }
}
```

### Writing tests

Now that I had set up my test target correctly, I could start writing some tests. Based on my code, I decided to write three separate tests:

1. A test that checks that the parser can parse a valid WIFI string with all fields present.
2. A test that checks that the parser throws an error when the WIFI string is invalid.
3. A test that checks that the parser can parse a valid WIFI string with only the required fields present.

### Defining tests

Something that has changed compared to `XCTest` is **how** you define unit tests. You no longer need to prefix your functions with `test` and you can now instead attach the `@Test` function to any function that you want to be a test:

```swift:WifiParserTests.swift
@Test
func whenParseIsCalledWithAllFields_ThenNetworkIsInitialisedCorrectly() {
    // ...
}
```

### Organising tests

In this new approach to testing, you have a lot more freedom in how you organise your tests. You can either declare them all as global functions or encapsulate them by purpose under either a `struct` or a `final class`.

There is also a dedicated `Suite` macro which you can attach to your `struct`s and allows you to do things such as changing the test suite name and not having to add the `@Test` macro to methods inside the struct:

```swift:WifiParserTests.swift
@Suite
struct WifiParserTests {
    func whenParseIsCalledWithAllFields_ThenNetworkIsInitialisedCorrectly() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

From what I can gather by reading the documentation, it seems to be **good practice** to attach the `@Suite` macro to `strutc`s that group unit tests.

### Testing when the WIFI string is not valid

The first test I wanted to add, and that would showcase some of the differences between `swift-testing` and `XCTest`, was to verify that the parser throws an error and sends a monitoring event when the WIFI string is not valid:

```swift:WifiParserTests.swift
@Suite
struct WifiParserTests {
    let sut: WifiParser
    let errorMonitoring: SpyErrorMonitoring

    // 1
    init() async throws {
        errorMonitoring = SpyErrorMonitoring()
        sut = WifiParser(monitoring: errorMonitoring)
    }

    func whenParseIsCalledWithWrongString_ThenNoMatchesErrorIsThrownAndMonitoringEventIsSent() {
        // 2
        #expect(throws: WifiParser.Error.noMatches) { try sut.parse(wifi: "") }
        // 3
        #expect(errorMonitoring.capturedErrors.compactMap { $0 as? WifiParser.Error } == [.noMatches])
    }
}
```

Let's break down the test suite above and understand what is going on:

1. The first thing I did was to set up the system under test (`WifiParser`) and the test double to spy on the monitoring events (`SpyErrorMonitoring`). In XCTest, you would usually do this in the `setUp` method so that the instances are created before each test. However, in `swift-testing`, since the suite is created before every test is run, it is sufficient to do this in the `init` method.
2. Use an overload of the `#expect` macro that allows you to assert that a closure throws a specific error. You can also pass in a type instead of an instance of the error if you don't want to be as specific.
3. Use the `#expect` macro with a boolean condition to assert that the spy has captured the correct error.

### Testing when all test fields are present

The second test I wrote checked that the parser could parse a valid WIFI string with all fields present:

```swift:WifiParserTests.swift
@Suite
struct WifiParserTests {
    func whenParseIsCalledWithAllFields_ThenNetworkIsInitialisedCorrectly() throws {
        let wifi = "WIFI:S:superwificonnection;T:WPA;P:strongpassword;H:YES;;"

        let network = try sut.parse(wifi: wifi)

        #expect(try #require(network.security) == "WPA")
        #expect(try #require(network.hidden) == "YES")
        #expect(network.ssid == "superwificonnection")
        #expect(network.password == "strongpassword")
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above and similarly to the way you would write tests in `XCTest`, you can still declare the methods as throwing (and even `async`) but, instead of having dedicated `XCTAssert` methods, you now have a single `#expect` macro that you can use to assert that a condition is true.

On top of this, and as you can see above where I am unwrapping the optional `security` and `hidden` property, instead of using `XCTUnwrap`, you can now use the throwing `#require` macro.

### Testing when only the required fields are present

The last test I added was to verify that my logic would still work even when the wifi string only had the required fields using only the `#expect` macro:

```swift:WifiParserTests.swift
@Suite
struct WifiParserTests {
    func whenParseIsCalledWithStringContainingOnlyRequiredFields_ThenCorrectValuesAreReturned() throws {
        let wifi = "WIFI:S:superwificonnection;P:strongpassword;;"

        let network = try sut.parse(wifi: wifi)

        #expect(network.hidden == nil)
        #expect(network.security == nil)
        #expect(network.ssid == "superwificonnection")
        #expect(network.password == "strongpassword")
    }
}
```

## Further reading

The examples above are just a small subset of what you can do with `swift-testing`. If you're trying the library out and struggling to find out how to do a specific assertion that you would normally do in `XCTest`, I recommend you check out [this migration chart from the documentation that compares both libraries at an assertion level](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-testing/main/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest#Converting-XCTAssert-XCTUnwrap-and-XCTFail-calls):
