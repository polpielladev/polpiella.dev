This week at work we have been looking into migrating third-party [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) dependencies to Swift Package Manager. We wanted to do this in a way where we maintained the same level of reproducibility and security that we currently had with CocoaPods or, if we couldn't, we reached an acceptable compromise. 

We started off by trying to get as close to our current Cocoapods setup:

* We have a `Podfile` at the root of the repo.
* We commit both the `Podfile.lock` file and the `Pods` directory to source control.
* We don't run `pod install` on CI.
* Any changes to the `Podfile.lock` file are both checked by developer committing the changes and people reviewing the PR.

This setup provides up with a number of benefits including highly reproducible builds both locally and on CI and an easier bootstrapping process for new developers (you can literally just clone the repo and build the app without installing cocoapods or any other third-party tool).

As package resolution is a step of the build process, there is no easy and automated way of installing all SPM dependencies into a *vendor* directory and committing it to source control. Hence, we decided to go for the next best option we had to ensure reproducible builds, which was **pinning dependencies to exact versions and committing the `Package.resolved` file to source control**.

## The problem

Whenever you add a Swift Package Manager dependency to a single Xcode project or to a Swift package or Xcode project within an `.xcworkspace`, the swift build system will generate/update a `Package.resolved` file under `<workspace_name>.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved`.

We initially thought that this would behave in the same way as lock files do in other dependency management system such as [CocoaPods](), where the `Podfile.lock` file only gets updated when you run a `pod install` and fails the build if there is a mismatch between the installed dependencies and the ones specified in such file. We quickly realised that `Package.resolved` works in a different way which required us to do some extra work. 

The package resolution step is integrated into the project's build system and, if something changes in your Swift Package Manager dependencies, the `Package.resolved` will update to reflect so during the build. That being said, if you decide to depend on a specific version of a package, this `Package.resolved` file shouldn't really change during a build but, when we did some tests, we uncovered a potential vulnerability risk we wanted to mitigate before switching our third-party dependencies over to Swift Package Manager: 

**Swift Package Manager relies on source control to resolve depedencies, which means that when you specify a version in your `Package.swift`, all you're really saying is that you want to check out a specific tag. Now, if someone decided to re-tag the version of a package we depend on to point to a different commit (with all the implications that could have), the build system would update the `Package.resolved` file to reflect this change the next time we build.**

While you would be able to tell that there's been a change locally if you commit `Package.resolved` to source control by running `git diff` after a build, this can be a big problem for CI builds, as you wouldn't be able to tell if there's been any changes. Imagine the scenario where one of your third-party dependencies has re-tagged a release to a different commit (completely untested and different from what you're expecting) and your release pipeline build picks that change up and gets it out to your users ðŸ˜±.

## An example

Let's explain the problem further by creating an Xcode project which relies on a single dependency called TestSPMPackage.

![Xcode project with a single dependency](/assets/posts/safely-pinning-spm-dependencies-to-exact-versions/xcode.webp)

TestSPMPackage has a single tag (v1.0.0), which points to a commit with sha `c959141bd7a39740f91e7e7431bb6d56ad84e4f6`. 

After adding the dependency to the project and specifying its version rule to be exactly `1.0.0`, the generated `Package.resolved` file looks like this:

```json:Package.resolved
{
  "pins" : [
    {
      "identity" : "testspmpackage",
      "kind" : "remoteSourceControl",
      "location" : "https://github.com/polpielladev/TestSPMPackage.git",
      "state" : {
        // This is the commit sha that the v1.0.0 tag points to
        // ðŸ‘‡
        "revision" : "c959141bd7a39740f91e7e7431bb6d56ad84e4f6",
        "version" : "1.0.0"
      }
    }
  ],
  "version" : 2
}
```

We commit this file to source control and push it to our remote repository. 

Let's now consider the scenario where someone decides to change the `v1.0.0` tag's commit to a different one with sha `48c496db8ecd8e12277ad27db7c2a92fd5f93438`. Next time we build the app, there will be a change to the `Package.resolved` file:

```json:Package.resolved
{
  "pins" : [
    {
      "identity" : "testspmpackage",
      "kind" : "remoteSourceControl",
      "location" : "https://github.com/polpielladev/TestSPMPackage.git",
      "state" : {
        // This is the NEW commit sha that the v1.0.0 tag points to
        // ðŸ‘‡
        "revision" : "48c496db8ecd8e12277ad27db7c2a92fd5f93438",
        "version" : "1.0.0"
      }
    }
  ],
  "version" : 2
}
```

While this is fine locally as the change shows up in our `git diff` and we still get the chance to confirm whether we are happy with this change of revision or we want to investigate the change further before proceeding, CI will still build fine and ship our app with the new revision without us noticing.

## The solution

Luckily, there is a flag built-in to `xcodebuild` which tells the build system to not update the `Package.resolved` file if anything changes and take it as an immutable source of truth: `-disableAutomaticPackageResolution`.

```bash:Terminal
xcodebuild 
  -workspace SomeWorkspace.xcworkspace                                          \
  -scheme Debug                                                                 \         
  -configuration Debug                                                          \          
  -derivedDataPath ./derived_data/                                              \
  # ðŸ‘‡
  -disableAutomaticPackageResolution                                            \
  -sdk 'iphonesimulator'                                                        \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=6C6A5129-4D65-4A35-A439-67C894B4FF65' \
  -enableCodeCoverage YES                                                       \
  build-for-testing
``` 

This flag tells `xcodebuild` to only resolve the Swift Package dependencies to revisions specified in your `Package.resolved`. Hence, if a dependency version was to be re-tagged to a commit different to that specified in `Package.resolved`, the build would fail and you would be able to investigate further.

Even better, if you are using [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/), you can pass this as a parameter to both the [gym](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/gym/) and [scan](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/scan/) actions ðŸŽ‰.

```ruby:Fastfile
run_tests(
  workspace: SomeWorkspace.xcworkspace,
  scheme: 'Debug',
  clean: true,
  device: 'iPhone 14',
  configuration: 'Debug',
  sdk: 'iphonesimulator',
  derived_data_path: './derived_data/',
  reset_simulator: true,
  build_for_testing: true
  # ðŸ‘‡
  disable_package_automatic_updates: true
)
```

## Future considerations

It is important to note that Apple are currently working on a Package Registry Service which would improve the Swift Package Manager ecosystem dramatically and potentially mitigate issues as the one described in this article. 

You can find out more about the Package Registry Service by reading proposal [SE-0292](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0292-package-registry-service.md).
