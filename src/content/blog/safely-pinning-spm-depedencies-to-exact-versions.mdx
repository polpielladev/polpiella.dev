This week at work we have been investigating what the best way to bring in 3rd party Swift Package Manager depedencies into our project is. 

We set off trying to copy the way we bring in 3rd party dependencies using CocoaPods, where we specify all pods and their versions in the `Podfile`, and then commit the `Podfile.lock` file and the `Pods` directory to source control to ensure reproducible builds on CI. This means that we don't really have to run `pod install` on CI, making for faster and more secure CI runs.
