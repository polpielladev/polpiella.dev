App Clips are a reduced version of your app and allow users to perform specific tasks without having to download the full app. They are lightweight as they are limited to 15MB in size and they are fast and intuitive to use.

App Clips can be launched by scanning an App Clip code generated with the camera type or by tapping an App Clip code generated with the NFC type. They can also be launched from Safari, Maps and Messages.
