I've been a software developer building iOS applications for the past 6 years and in that amount of time, I have seen numerous changes to the industry and the responsibilities of my role.

I have seen new architecture patterns and trends come and go, new frameworks and languages emerge and old ones phase-out and, especially at the beginning of my career but still to this day, I do at times feel overwhelmed by the amount of information that I need to keep up with as a software developer.

To mitigate this feeling and to ensure that I am always learning and growing as a software engineer, I have developed a few habits that I would like to share with you in this article.

## Newsletters, blogs and RSS feeds

There are numerous content creators and companies sharing updates and news that help me keep up with what's going on in the industry. These usually come in the form of blog posts and newsletters that gather these posts and news every so often and send them as emails to all subscribers.

### What newsletters do I subscribe to?

I subscribe to a few newsletters that I find very useful and I try to find the right balance between iOS development-specific and more general software development newsletters.

This helps me cover a wide range of topics and stay up to date both with what's going on in my area of expertise and with what's going on in the industry as a whole.

Here are the iOS development-specific newsletters that I subscribe to:

- [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/)
- [SwiftLee Weekly](https://www.avanderlee.com/)
- [Swift Evolution](https://swiftevolution.substack.com/)
- [](http://weekly.swiftwithmajid.com/)
- [](https://not-only-swift.peterfriese.dev/)

And also some other more general software and app development newsletters:

- [](https://accessible-mobile-apps-weekly.ghost.io/)
- [](https://marclou.beehiiv.com/)
- [](https://www.itbrew.com/)
- [](https://www.therundown.ai/)

### The magic of RSS feeds

If there is a blog that I find particularly interesting and that I want to keep up with that has an RSS feed available (most blogs do), I will subscribe to it using an RSS reader. You will also usually find that even newsletters have an RSS feed available so you can bring all your articles and reading into one place.

There are plenty of RSS readers available out there, but my all-time favorite is the macOS application [NetNewsWire](), which also comes with a Safari extension that detects RSS feeds on the websites you visit and allows you to subscribe to them with a single click:

## Podcasts

Similarly to newsletters, there are plenty of podcasts out there that cover a wide range of Software Development topics that I listen to regularly.

I don't listen to a lot of them, but these are the ones I keep up with the most:

- [Caffe Swift](https://cuonda.com/caffe-swift)
- [The talk show with John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/)

## Writing and sharing content

## Side projects

There is only so much you can learn from consuming content alone and, at some point, you need to start applying what you have learned to truly understand it and to be able to add it to your skillset.

While this seems easy to say, it can be hard to find opportunities to apply what you have learned in your day-to-day job, be it because of the nature of the project you are working on or because of the struggle of finding the time and buy-in from stakeholders to do so.

This is something I have faced in the past and, the best way I have found to overcome this is to work on side projects. I have learned a lot from working on apps I have shipped on my own and I would thoroughly encourage you to ship your apps as well. Regardless of whether the apps end up being a success or not, you will learn a lot from the process and you will be able to add that experience to your skillset.
