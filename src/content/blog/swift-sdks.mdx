As a developer for Apple platforms, you will be familiar with cross-compiling code for different platforms such as iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS with very minimal setup and directly from Xcode or using the latest Swift toolchain.

However, if you'd like to compile Swift code for other platforms such as Linux, you need a lot more setup

## What are Swift SDKs?

First introduced in the [SE-0387](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0387-cross-compilation-destinations.md) proposal and built into SPM (from versions of Swift 5.9 and above), Swift SDKs are artifact bundles which contain all necessary files to cross-compile Swift code for specific platforms.

Swift SDKs can be retrieved, installed and used with the same `swift` command line tool you use to compile Swift code by passing it the `experimental-sdk` flag:

```bash:Terminal
# List all installed Swift SDKs
swift experimental-sdk list
# Install a Swift SDK
swift experimental-sdk install <bundle-path-or-url>
# Remove an installed SDK
swift experimental-sdk remove <sdk-id-or-bundle-name>
```
