As the year is coming to an end, and as I did last year, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on what I have been up to in 2023, how I have performed against my goals, and set some public goals for 2024 to keep myself accountable.

## A review of 2023

Let's start by reviewing some of the things I have been up to in 2023 that I am most proud of.

### The highlights

#### My own apps!

This is by far the thing that I am most proud of this year! After a long time of being an iOS developer, I can finally say that I have my own apps in the App Store!

I finally decided to overcome all my fears and with a bunch of encouragement from mates and colleagues I decided to take a leap and ship my first solo app [QReate]().

While it has been challenging at times, it has been an amazing learning process and seeing your app being used in the wild is an incredibly rewarding feeling!

On top of this, and after meeting [Hidde]() at a conference, we decided to join forces and work together on [NowPlaying](). It's a super fun project and working with mates on an app that you are passionate about is just the best!

#### Public speaking

This year I have been lucky enough to speak at 6 different developer events all over the world which, considering that I only spoke at a single in-person conference in 2022, is a huge improvement!

Not only has it been a great opportunity to improve my public speaking skills, but it has also been a great way to meet new people, make new friends, and explore amazing parts of the world such as Turin or New York!

I would thoroughly recommend anyone to give in-person conferences a go, it's a fantastic way to grow professionally and find people who, as it was in my case with [Hidde](), can even become your business partners!

#### Sponsors

#### A new adventure

### My goals

Now that I have shared some highlights, I want to take a moment to review the goals I set for myself at the beginning of the year one by one.

I find this to be a great exercise to keep myself accountable and find areas of improvement for the next year.

#### 1. Weekly articles on my blog

#### 2. Speaking at more than 5 conferences or events

#### 3. Find a sponsor for my blog or the newsletter

#### 4. Grow my Twitter following to 1k

#### 5. Release a monetisable product

#### 6. Grow the iOS CI Newsletter to at least 500 subscribers
