Swift is a great language choice for writing cross-platform libraries and command-line applications. While Swift is commonly used on Apple platforms and Linux, it is also possible to run Swift programs on Windows.

Despite this, setting up a Windows development environment for Swift can be a bit of a challenge as you might be developing on a Mac or Linux machine. In this article, I will show you how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow to build and test your Swift project on Windows.

## Building the workflow

Let's consider we have a Swift package with a single executable target and product and we want to make it available for Windows users.

We can do so by creating a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every push to the `main` branch and builds the package on a Windows machine:

```yaml:windows.yml
name: Build for Windows

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  build-windows-executable:
    name: Build Windows Executable
    # 1
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      # 2
      - uses: compnerd/gha-setup-swift@main
        with:
          branch: swift-5.6-release
          tag: 5.6-RELEASE
      # 3
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # 4
      - run: git config --global core.protectNTFS false
      # 5
      - run: swift build -c release --static-swift-stdlib --product ReadingTimeCLI
      # 6
      - run: cp .build\release\ReadingTimeCLI.exe ReadingTimeCLI.exe
      # 7
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: ReadingTimeCLI-windows.exe
          path: ReadingTimeCLI.exe
```

Let's break down the workflow above step by step:

1. We specify that the workflow should run on the most up-to-date Windows machine available.
2. We use the [gha-setup-swift]() action which will make the Swift toolchain available on the machine.
3. We check out the repository.
4. We disable NTFS protection as it can cause issues when copying files and cloning the repository.
5. We build the package using the `swift build` command. We specify the `--static-swift-stdlib` flag to statically link the Swift standard library.
6. We copy the executable from the build folder to the root of the repository. We must remember to use the backslash (`\`) as the path separator as opposed to what we would normally use on Unix systems (`/`).
7. We upload the executable as an artefact using GitHub's own [actions/upload-artifact]() action so that we can download it later.
