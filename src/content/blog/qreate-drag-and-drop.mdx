I have recently finished a new feature for my app [QReate](https://testflight.apple.com/join/B5D8pm9C) that allows users to add images to their custom QR codes.

I wanted to make the experience as native and intuitive as possible, so I decided to add support for dragging and dropping images directly onto the editor and, much to my surprise coming from a UIKit background, it was a breeze to implement in SwiftUI:

<Video name="qreate-drag-and-drop-finished.mp4" />

## The view

The view I added support for dragging and dropping images to is simple and acts as a canvas for the QR code the user is creating:

```swift:QRCodeCanvas.swift
import SwiftUI

struct QRCodeCanvas: View {
    @Binding var qrCode: QRCodeModel

    var body: some View {
        QRCodeView(qrCode: $qrCode)
    }
}
```

## Adding support for dragging and dropping

Adding support for dragging and dropping images onto a SwiftUI view is rather simple. You just need to add a view modifier, specify the file types (`UTTypes`) you'd like to support (in this case just `.image`) and provide a closure that will be called when the user drops an image onto the view.

We will also create a `@State` property to keep track of whether the user is currently dragging an image over the view or not so that we can update our UI accordingly:

```swift:QRCodeCanvas.swift
import SwiftUI
import QRCode

struct QRCodeCanvas: View {
    @Binding var qrCode: QRCodeModel
    @State private var isTargeted: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        QRCodeView(qrCode: $qrCode)
            .onDrop(of: [.image], isTargeted: $isTargeted, perform: { providers in
                return true
            })
    }
}
```

While we are already supporting dragging and dropping images onto the view, we are not making it clear to the user that such a feature is available:

<Video name="qreate-drag-and-drop-no-feedback.mp4" />

## Updating the UI

Let's now provide an overlay that is only shown when the `isTargeted` property is set to `true`.

To make things look as smooth as possible, we will also add a view modifier to animate any changes to the view affected by the `isTargeted` property:

```swift:QRCodeCanvas.swift
import SwiftUI

struct QRCodeCanvas: View {
    @Binding var qrCode: QRCodeModel
    @State private var isTargeted: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        QRCodeView(qrCode: $qrCode)
            .onDrop(of: [.image], isTargeted: $isTargeted, perform: { providers in
                return true
            })
            .overlay {
                if isTargeted {
                    ZStack {
                        Color.black.opacity(0.7)

                        VStack(spacing: 8) {
                            Image(systemName: "plus.circle.fill")
                                .font(.system(size: 60))
                            Text("Drop your image here...")
                        }
                        .font(.largeTitle)
                        .fontWeight(.heavy)
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                        .frame(maxWidth: 250)
                        .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                    }
                }
            }
            .animation(.default, value: isTargeted)
    }
}
```

When we next run the app and drag an image over the view, we should see the following:

<Video name="qreate-drag-and-drop-overlay.mp4" />

## Hadling a drop

Last but not least, we need to do something whenever the user drops an image onto the view.

In the closure we provide to the `onDrop` view modifier, we need to make sure we can get the first provider from the closure's parameter and then load the data representation for the `.image` type. We can then initialise an `NSImage` instance with that data and assign it to the QR code model so it displays on top of the QR code.

```swift:QRCodeCanvas.swift
import SwiftUI
import QRCode

struct QRCodeCanvas: View {
    @Binding var qrCode: QRCodeModel
    @State private var isTargeted: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        QRCodeView(qrCode: $qrCode)
            .onDrop(of: [.image], isTargeted: $isTargeted, perform: { providers in
                guard let provider = providers.first else { return false }

                _ = provider.loadDataRepresentation(for: .image) { data, error in
                    if error == nil, let data {
                        DispatchQueue.main.async {
                            qrCode.image.image = NSImage(data: data)
                        }
                    }
                }

                return true
            })
            .overlay {
                if isTargeted {
                    ZStack {
                        Color.black.opacity(0.7)

                        VStack(spacing: 8) {
                            Image(systemName: "plus.circle.fill")
                                .font(.system(size: 60))
                            Text("Drop your image here...")
                        }
                        .font(.largeTitle)
                        .fontWeight(.heavy)
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                        .frame(maxWidth: 250)
                        .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                    }
                }
            }
            .animation(.default, value: isTargeted)
    }
}
```

And with that, we are done! We can now drag and drop images onto our view and they will be shown on top of the QR code. ðŸŽ‰
