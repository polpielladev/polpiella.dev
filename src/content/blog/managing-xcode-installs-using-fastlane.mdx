The [2.211.0 release of Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.211.0) comes with a brand new action: [xcodes](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes). This new action, implemented by [@rogerluan\_](https://twitter.com/rogerluan_), allows you to install, select and manage multiple versions of Xcode directly from Fastlane.

As well as introducing a new action, this release deprecates the existing [xcode-install](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcode_install) and [xcversion](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcversion) actions too.

This post will explore the current state of Xcode version management on CI using Fastlane, and will explain how the new [xcodes action](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes) works.

## Selecting a version of Xcode

Selecting a version of Xcode at the beginning of Fastlane's execution can be a very useful way of making your workflows as portable and reusable as possible for you and your team.

Fastlane usually runs in a CI environment, which means that you want to make sure that selecting an Xcode version does not meddle with the system's settings and does not require any manual intervention, such as asking for sudo permissions.

Both the existing [xcode_select](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcode_select) and the new [xcodes](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes) actions are able to achieve this by setting the `DEVELOPER_DIR` environment variable to the path of an Xcode application.

Contrary to what running `xcode-select -s` does, setting the `DEVELOPER_DIR` environment variable does not require root permissions and only affects the current shell session.

### Using [xcode_select](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcode_select)

The [xcode_select](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcode_select) action is the simplest and less intrusive way of selecting an Xcode version. The action requires the full path to an Xcode application (e.g. `/Applications/Xcode_14.1.app`) and it uses this path to set the `DEVELOPER_DIR` environment variable.

```ruby:fastlane/Fastfile
# Set the version before every lane...
before_all do
    xcode_select("/Applications/Xcode-14.1.app")
end
```

A big downside to this approach is that, since [xcode_select](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcode_select) requires a full path to the Xcode application, you need to have a strict naming convention for all Xcode installations across all your CI runners.

Even if you don't use self-hosted runners, if you want your lanes to work locally, you need to ensure that the path to your local Xcode installation matches that of the CI runner.

### Using [xcodes](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes)

The alternative to using [xcode_select](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcode_select) now that both [xcode-install](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcode_install) and [xcversion](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcversion) are depecrated, is the [xcodes action](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes). This action is a wrapper around the [xcodes CLI](https://github.com/RobotsAndPencils/xcodes), an application I have used for a very long time to manage Xcode versions on my machine.

The downside to this new lane is that it does not work out-of-the-box as it relies on the system having [the xcodes cli](https://github.com/RobotsAndPencils/xcodes) installed.

#### Installing [xcodes](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes)

The [xcodes](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes) command line tool is available on Homebrew, and can be installed by running:

```bash:Terminal
brew install robotsandpencils/made/xcodes
```

#### Selecting an installed version using [xcodes](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes)

Similarily to the way [xcode_select](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcode_select) works, [xcodes](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes) can be used to select a version of Xcode which is already installed in the system.

The [xcodes](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes) action uses a version parameter instead of a full path to a `.app` file and finds the correct Xcode application in the system from the given version.

By default, the action will install the queried version of Xcode if it can't be found in the system and select it system-wide. This behaviour can be disabled by setting the `select_for_current_build_only` parameter to `true`, which I would thoroughly recommend:

```ruby:fastlane/Fastfile
before_all do
    xcodes(version: "14.1", select_for_current_build_only: true)
end
```

> Note that the `xcodes` action expects a valid [RubyGems style requirements](https://guides.rubygems.org/releasing-rubygems) for the version parameter. For example, you would select a stable version of Xcode by passing `14.1`, and a pre-release version by passing `14.1.beta.3`.

#### Creating an `.xcode-version` file

The `xcodes` action can also be used to select a version of Xcode based on the contents of a `.xcode-version` file at the root of your project. This is a very common pattern in other version managers such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [swiftenv](https://github.com/kylef/swiftenv).

Let's consider the following `.xcode-version` file:

```plaintext:.xcode-version
14.1
```

You can then modify the code in the previous section to use the version specified in the `.xcode-version` file by not passing the `version` parameter to the [xcodes action](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes):

```ruby:fastlane/Fastfile
before_all do
    xcodes(select_for_current_build_only: true)
end
```

## Install if needed

Now that we've seen how you can select a version of Xcode that is already installed in the system, let's see how you can install one that's not available locally.

> Note that running the action without `select_for_current_build_only` requires authentication with Apple's Developer Portal as well as `sudo` permissions to change the selected Xcode version system-wide.

To make the [xcodes action](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes) install a version of Xcode if it can't be found in the system, simply set the `select_for_current_build_only` parameter to `false` (or don't pass it at all as it defaults to `false`).

You must be aware that this has a potentially undesirable side-effect: the action will select the newly installed version of Xcode system-wide, **requiring sudo permissions**.

```ruby:fastlane/Fastfile
lane :install_xcode do |values|
    # Specifying the version directly
    xcodes(version: values[:version])

    # Or using a .xcode-version file
    xcodes
end
```

The list of available Xcode versions to download is always updated before a new version is installed. If you don't want the list to be updated, you can set the `update_list` parameter to `false`:

```ruby:fastlane/Fastfile
lane :install_xcode do |values|
    # Specifying the version directly
    xcodes(version: values[:version], update_list: false)

    # Or using a .xcode-version file
    xcodes(update_list: false)
end
```

## Going the extra mile üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you'd like to get some extra validation in place and make sure that the selected version of Xcode is the one you expect, there are some extra actions you can use.

### Ensuring the selected version of Xcode is correct

You can verify that the correct version of Xcode has indeed been selected by using the [ensure_xcode_version action](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/ensure_xcode_version).

This action takes in a version string as a parameter and fails the build if the selected version of Xcode does not match the input string.

```ruby:fastlane/Fastfile
before_all do
    # Select the version of Xcode for this build only
    xcodes(version: "14.1", select_for_current_build_only: true)

    # Make sure that the correct version of Xcode is selected
    ensure_xcode_version(version: "14.1")
end
```

It is also worth mentioning that, similarly to the way the [xcodes](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes) action works, [ensure_xcode_version](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/ensure_xcode_version) looks for a version string in a `.xcode-version` file at the root of the repository only if the `version` parameter isn't present in the action call.

```ruby:fastlane/Fastfile
before_all do
    # Select the version of Xcode for this build only
    # Uses `.xcode-version` file
    xcodes(select_for_current_build_only: true)

    # Make sure that the correct version of Xcode is selected
    # Uses `.xcode-version` file
    ensure_xcode_version
end
```

### Validate the newly installed version of Xcode

If you are installing a new version of Xcode using the [xcodes action](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/xcodes), you can use [verify_xcode](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/verify_xcode) to ensure that the newly installed version of Xcode is properly signed by Apple.

The action can be passed a path to the Xcode application to verify, or alternatively it can use the currently selected version of Xcode if the `xcode_path` parameter is omitted.

```ruby:fastlane/Fastfile
lane :install_xcode do |values|
    # Install and select an Xcode version
    xcodes(version: values[:version])

    # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the newly installed version of Xcode
    # Gets the path from the environment
    verify_xcode

    # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the newly installed version of Xcode
    # Uses the path parameter
    verify_xcode(xcode_path: "/Applications/Xcode.14.1.app")
end
```
