The [2.211.0 release of Fastlane]() introduces a new action to manage Xcode versions directly from fastlane. As well as introducing a new lane, this release also deprecates the existing [xcode-install]() and [xcversion]() actions.

This post will explore the current state of Xcode version management on CI using Fastlane.

## Setting a version

### Using `xcode_select`

The `xcode_select` action is the simplest and less invasive way of selecting an Xcode version to use. The action requires is the full path to an Xcode application (e.g. `/Applications/Xcode_14.3.app`) and the only thing it does is set the `DEVELOPER_DIR` environment variable to the path provided.

Setting the `DEVELOPER_DIR` environment variable only selects a version of Xcode for a given Fastlane execution and does not change the system's selection.

```ruby
# Set the version before every lane...
before_all do
    xcode_select("/Applications/Xcode-14.1.app")
end
```

A big downside of this approach is that, since it requires a full path to the Xcode application, it requires a strict naming convention for all Xcode installations across all runners.

### Using `xcodes`

The alternative to using `xcode_select` now that both `xcode-install` and `xcversion` are depecrated is the `xcodes` action. This action is a wrapper around the [xcodes CLI](), an application I have used for a very long time to manage Xcode versions on my machine.

The downside to this new lane is that it no longer works out-of-the-box as it relies on the system having [xcodes]() installed.

## Installing `xcodes`

The `xcodes` command line tool is available on Homebrew, and can be installed it by running:

```bash
brew install robotsandpencils/made/xcodes
```

### Selecting an available version

Similarily to the way `xcode-select` works, `xcodes` can be used to select a version of Xcode which is already installed in the system.

The `xcodes` action uses a version parameter instead of a path and finds the correct Xcode application in the system.

By default, the action will install the queried version of Xcode if it can't be found in the system and select it system-wide. This behaviour can be disabled by setting the `select_for_current_build_only` parameter to `true`, which I would thoroughly recommend:

```ruby
# Set the version before every lane...
before_all do
    xcodes(version: "14.1", select_for_current_build_only: true)
end
```

> Note that the `xcodes` action expects a valid [RubyGems style requirements]() for the version parameter. For example, you would select a stable version of Xcode by passing `14.1`, and a pre-release version by passing `14.1.beta.3`.

### Creating a `.xcode-version` file

The `xcodes` action can also be used to select a version of Xcode based on the contents of a `.xcode-version` file. This is a very common pattern in other version managers such as [rbenv](), [nvm]() and [swiftenv]().

Let's consider the following `.xcode-version` file:

```.xcode-version
14.1
```

### Install if needed

Now that we've seen how you can select a version of Xcode that is already installed in the system, let's see how you can install a version of Xcode that is not already installed.

> Note that running the action without `select_for_current_build_only` requires authentication with Apple's Developer Portal as well as `sudo` permissions to change the selected Xcode version system-wide.
