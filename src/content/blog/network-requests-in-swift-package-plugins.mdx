The merge of [PR #6114](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/6114) in the Swift Package Manager repository confirms one of the features I have long been waiting for: the ability to make network requests in Swift package plugins. This feature will be officially available from Swift 5.9 onwards, but it is already available on the [latest development snapshots of Swift](https://www.swift.org/download/#trunk-development-main) ðŸŽ‰.

The moment I found out that this feature had landed in the repository's main branch, I knew I had to try it out and write about it, the same way I did when [extensible build tools were first introduced](https://www.polpiella.dev/an-early-look-at-swift-extensible-build-tools).

## An overview

As of the release of `Swift 5.9`, a new type of permission will be added to Swift package command plugins: `allowNetworkConnections`. This permission will allow a plugin to make network requests to a Docker daemon, a local or remote server and to Unix domain sockets. The initial PR also adds the option of specifying a list of ports which are allowed when making network requests but does not allow for specifying a list of domains.

The new `allowNetworkConnections` permission requires a **scope**, which determines which requests can or can't be made from the plugin's code. The available scopes at the moment are:

- `docker` - allows the plugin to communicate with a Docker daemon.
- `local` - allows the plugin to communicate with a server local to the system where the plugin is executing. This enum case has an associated value `ports`, to only allow requests to local servers running on any of the ports specified.
- `all` - allows the plugin to make a request to any domain, both local and remote. This enum case has an associated value `ports`, to only allow requests to servers (local or remote) running on any of the ports specified.
- `unixDomainSocket` - allows the plugin to communicate with a Unix domain socket.

If you have written a Swift package command plugin before which required modifying/creating files, you will already be familiar with how to add a permission to your plugin. The `allowNetworkConnections` permission is no different to the existing `writeToPackageDirectory` permission. You will see how to do so in the following sections.

## Communicating with docker

Let's consider an example of a Swift package plugin that communicates with Docker to perform some build operations. The plugin will be able to start a docker container and execute `swift build` on it. In this case, the plugin will make use of one of Swift's official main nightly build containers to compile a Swift executable target into a `amazonlinux2` compatible binary.

> Note that the container I used for this example has version `5.9` of Swift package manager as it is a development snapshot built overnight from [Swift's main branch](https://github.com/apple/swift). This example wouldn't work with the latest stable docker image of Swift, as it wouldn't have the network permission feature available.

First, let's define a plugin target in the `Package.swift` file:

```swift:Package.swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "PluginsPermissionsTest",
    products: [
        // Products define the executables and libraries a package produces, and make them visible to other packages.
        .library(
            name: "PluginsPermissionsTest",
            targets: ["PluginsPermissionsTest"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "PluginsPermissionsTest",
            dependencies: []
        ),
        .plugin(
            name: "Docker",
            capability: .command (
                intent: .custom(verb: "compile-to-amazonlinux2", description: "Compile executable to amazon linux 2"),
                permissions: [
                    .allowNetworkConnections(
                        scope: .docker,
                        reason: "The plugin must connect to the docker daemon to compile Swift code to amazonlinux2"
                    )
                ]
            )
        )
    ]
)
```

Then, let's write the code for the plugin:

```swift:Plugins/Docker/Docker.swift
@main
struct Docker: CommandPlugin {
    func performCommand(context: PluginContext, arguments: [String]) throws {
        // 1
        let docker = try context.tool(named: "docker").path

        // 2
        try shell(command: docker, arguments: [
            "run",
            "--rm",
            "--volume", "\(context.package.directory.string):/src",
            "--workdir", "/src",
            "swiftlang/swift:nightly-amazonlinux2",
            "swift", "build", "-c", "release"
        ])
    }
}
```

Let's go through the code above in more detail:

1. Retrieve the path to the `docker` executable from the context. In this case, the context will know to use the system `docker` executable.
2. Run a command using a helper method `shell`, which wraps a call to `Process`, executes the command with the given arguments and returns a `String`. I won't go into too much detail about what the command itself does, but all you need to know is that it will run `swift build` on a docker container running `swiftlang/swift:nightly-amazonlinux2`. The plugin command will produce a linux-compatible executable of the `PluginsPermissionsTest` target in the current working directory.

We can then run the plugin from the command line like so:

```bash:Terminal
# Set the version of Swift to a development snapshot with Swift 5.9
swiftenv local DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2023-02-19-a

# Run the plugin
swift package compile-to-amazonlinux2 --allow-network-connections docker
```

Before the plugin executes, it will ask for permissions to make network requests to Docker. As shown in the code snippet above, you can also make this command not interactive by passing the `--allow-network-connections` flag to the plugin command. This is very useful for running the plugin in a CI environment or when you have to call it repeatedly.

Once the plugin has all necessary permissions, it will interact with Docker's daemon to run swift build on an `amazonlinx2` docker instance and output a linux-compatible executable to the package's current working directory under: '.build/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/PluginsPermissionsTest'.

## Communicating with a local server

Let's now see how a plugin can be used to communicate with a local server running at port `30`. Again, the first thing to do is to define a plugin target and this time give it an `allowNetworkConnections` permission with `local` scope so that it can fetch the contents of `config.json` from a local server and a `writeToPackageDirectory` permission so it can write such contents to a file:

```swift:Package.swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "PluginsPermissionsTest",
    // ...
    targets: [
        .plugin(
            name: "FetchConfig",
            capability: .command (
                intent: .custom(verb: "fetch-config", description: "Fetch a `config.json` resource and embed it in the package"),
                permissions: [
                    .allowNetworkConnections(
                        scope: .local(ports: [30]),
                        reason: "The plugin must connect to a local server running at port 30 to fetch a resource"
                    ),
                    .writeToPackageDirectory(reason: "Write the fetched `config.json` to the package's root directory")
                ]
            )
        )
    ]
)
```

Let's now write the code for a plugin which fetches a configuration file (`.json`) from a local server and drops it in the package's root directory.

```swift:Plugins/FetchConfig/FetchConfig.swift
@main
struct FetchConfig: CommandPlugin {
    func performCommand(context: PluginContext, arguments: [String]) throws {
        // 1
        let curl = try context.tool(named: "curl").path

        // 2
        let response = try shell(executable: curl, arguments: [
            "http://localhost:30/config.json",
            "-o",
            context.package.directory.appending(subpath: "config.json").string
        ])

        // 3
        print(response)
    }
}
```

Let's go through the code above in more detail:

1. Retrieve the path to the `curl` executable from the context. In this case, the context will know to use the system's `curl` executable.
2. Run a command using a helper method `shell`, which wraps a call to `Process`, executes the command with the given arguments and returns a `String`. The command executes a network request to `http://localhost:30/config.json` and saves the response to the package's root directory under `config.json` using `curl`.
3. Print the command's output to the terminal.

To test this, I created a dummy `config.json` file on my desktop and then run a local server using `python3`:

```bash:Terminal
# Create a dummy config.json file
echo '{"foo": "bar"}' > ~/Desktop/config.json

# Run a local server on port 30
python3 -m http.server 30
```

Now that the local server is running, we can now run the plugin from the command line like so:

```bash:Terminal
# Set the version of Swift to a development snapshot with Swift 5.9
swiftenv local DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2023-02-19-a

# Run the plugin
swift package fetch-config                  \
    --allow-writing-to-package-directory    \
    --allow-network-connections local
```

Once you do so, you should see `curl`'s output in the terminal and a new file (`config.json`) at the root of the package's directory:

## Communicating with a remote server

Let's now modify the URL we used in the previous example and change the URL to point to a remote endpoint instead:

```swift:Plugins/FetchConfig/FetchConfig.swift
@main
struct FetchConfig: CommandPlugin {
    func performCommand(context: PluginContext, arguments: [String]) throws {
        let curl = try context.tool(named: "curl").path

        let response = try execute(executable: curl, arguments: [
            "hhttps://httpbin.org/json",
            "-o",
            context.package.directory.appending(subpath: "config.json").string
        ])
    }
}
```

> Note that for testing sake I am using [httpbin.org]() to get a JSON response which I can then write to a file. You can use any remote endpoint you want.

If we run this plugin now, we will get the following error:

![]()

This is because the plugin is trying to make a network request to a remote server, and we have not yet granted it permission to do so. Let's fix that by adding the following permission to the plugin's manifest:

```swift:Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "PluginsPermissionsTest",
    // ...
    targets: [
        .plugin(
            name: "FetchConfig",
            capability: .command (
                intent: .custom(verb: "fetch-config", description: "Fetch a `config.json` resource and embed it in the package"),
                permissions: [
                    .allowNetworkConnections(
                        scope: .all(ports: []),
                        reason: "Allow remote connections to fetch a `config.json` file"
                    )
                ]
            )
        )
    ]
)
```

Let's now re-run the plugin and grant it the permissions it needs:

> Note that all examples above would work with the `.all` scope as well, as it allows the plugin to execute all network requests, regardless of their domain, port or whether they are local or remote.
