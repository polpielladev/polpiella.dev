I have been writing command-line tools with Swift for a while now and, while I find the developer experience to be great, I have always found the number of libraries to handle user input to be lacking compared to other languages such as Javascript.

This sparked my interest in learning more about how such libraries work in other languages and how hard it would be to make something similar using Swift.

In this post, I will show you how to make a simple interactive picker for a command-line tool using ANSI escape sequences inspired in one of my favorite javascript libraries [clack](https://github.com/natemoo-re/clack) by [Nate Moore](https://twitter.com/n_moore). I like the library so much that I have started working on migrating it to Swift and I am going to document my progress in a series of posts.
