This week at work I have been looking at collecting metrics from [Github Actions Workflow runs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs#list-workflow-runs-for-a-repository). These metrics will help us monitor and plot the duration of our Github Action workflows over time.

To achieve this, I created a command line application which queries [Github's API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs#list-workflow-runs-for-a-repository) and uses its response to calculate how long each workflow run takes.

The command line application is built using an executable target in a Swift Package with the help of [Apple's swift-argument-parser library](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser). Specifically, the application makes use of the [AsyncParsableCommand](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser/blob/main/Sources/ArgumentParser/Parsable%20Types/AsyncParsableCommand.swift) to run asynchronous code within an `async/await` context.

## Creating a Swift Package

The first step to create a command line tool with Swift is to create a Swift Package:

```bash:Terminal
swift package init --type executable
```

Amongst other files, the command above generates a `Package.swift` file with an executable target and product. To use [swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser), declare it as a package dependency and add it to the `executableTarget`'s dependency list:

```swift:Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.7

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "GithubWorkflowMetrics",
    platforms: [.macOS(.v10_15)],
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser.git",
            from: "1.2.0"
        )
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "GithubWorkflowMetrics",
            dependencies: [.product(name: "ArgumentParser", package: "swift-argument-parser")]
        )
    ]
)
```

> [swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) only introduced `async/await` support in [version 1.1.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser/releases/tag/1.1.0). If you want to take advantage of these APIs, you will need to use a version higher or equal to 1.1.0.

## Creating the entry point

The executable target needs to know what actions to perform when it runs. The entry point for the application is defined under `Sources/GithubWorkflowMetrics/GithubWorkflowMetrics.swift`:

```swift:GithubWorkflowMetrics.swift
import ArgumentParser
import Foundation

@main
struct GithubWorkflowMetrics: AsyncParsableCommand {
    @Argument(help: "The repository data should be parsed from in `user/repo` format")
    var repository: String

    @Option(help: "The bearer token to perform the request")
    var token: String?

    func run() async throws {
    }
}
```

The code above declares a `struct` conforming to `AsyncParsableCommand` decorated with `@main` to indicate it is the entry point for the executable target. The `GithubWorkflowMetrics` `struct` implements the `async` `run` method declared in the `AsyncParsableCommand` protocol from [swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) and defines two properties:

1. A repository to get workflow data from. This argument is required and, if not provided, will cause the application to fail. The `repository` property is decorated with the `@Argument` property wrapper from [swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) to ensure it is passed as such.
2. A token string to authorise the request to [Github's api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). This property is optional and should only be passed as an option when trying to access private repositories. The property is decorated with the `@Option` property wrapper from [swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) for this reason.

## Calling Github's API

Github's API provides an [endpoint to retrieve all workflow runs for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs#list-workflow-runs-for-a-repository). The app can make use of [URLSession's await-friendly APIs](https://wwdcbysundell.com/2021/using-async-await-with-urlsession/) to call the workflow runs endpoint and decode the response data from the API into a `Decodable` type:

```swift:GithubWorkflowMetrics.swift
struct WorkflowsResponse: Decodable {
    let workflowRuns: [Workflow]
}

struct Workflow: Decodable {
    let name: String
    let id: Int
    let runStartedAt: Date
    let updatedAt: Date
    let conclusion: String?
}

extension JSONDecoder {
    static let snakeCaseDecoder: JSONDecoder = {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase
        decoder.dateDecodingStrategy = .iso8601
        return decoder
    }()
}

func run() async throws {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.github.com/repos/\(repository)/actions/runs?status=success&created=\(DateProvider.provide())")!
    var urlRequest = URLRequest(url: url, cachePolicy: .returnCacheDataElseLoad)
    if let token {
        urlRequest
            .setValue(
                "Bearer \(token)",
                forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization"
            )
    }

    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: urlRequest)
    let decodedData = try JSONDecoder
        .snakeCaseDecoder
        .decode(WorkflowsResponse.self, from: data)
}
```

> [The workflow runs endpoint in Github's API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs#list-workflow-runs-for-a-repository) returns JSON data with [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) formatted keys. The `snakeCaseDecoder` in the code snippet above uses `convertFromSnakeCase` as its `keyDecodingStrategy` to convert the [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) formatted keys from Github's response back into the `Decodable` type's [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) formatted properties. The `snakeCaseDecoder` also specifies `iso8601` as its `dateDecodingStrategy` to decode [ISO8601 compliant](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) dates from Github's API's response into `Date` types.

## Generating the output

The application needs to output the metrics collected from [Github's API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) in a suitable format.

I decided to output a `JSON` object with the following format:

```json:Output.json
{
	"workflow_name": [
		{
			"date": "workflow_run_date",
			"duration": "workflow_run_duration"
		},
		{
			"date": "workflow_run_date",
			"duration": "workflow_run_duration"
		},
	]
}
```

The `Swift` code below performs the necessary operations to transform the data coming from Github's API into the output object above:

```swift:GithubWorkflowMetrics.swift
struct Output: Encodable {
    var dataPoints: [String: [WorkflowDataPoint]] = [:]
}

struct WorkflowDataPoint: Encodable {
    let duration: TimeInterval
    let date: Date
}

extension JSONEncoder {
    static let snakeCaseEncoder: JSONEncoder = {
        let encoder = JSONEncoder()
        encoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase
        encoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .iso8601
        encoder.outputFormatting = .prettyPrinted
        return encoder
    }()
}

func run() async throws {
	// ...
	// 1
	decodedData
            .workflowRuns
            .reduce(into: [String: [WorkflowDataPoint]]()) { partialOutput, workflow in
                let duration = workflow
                    .updatedAt
                    .timeIntervalSince(workflow.runStartedAt)
                let dataPoint = WorkflowDataPoint(
                    duration: duration,
                    date: workflow.runStartedAt
                )
                if var timeIntervals = partialOutput[workflow.name] {
                    timeIntervals.append(dataPoint)
                    partialOutput[workflow.name] = timeIntervals
                } else {
                    partialOutput[workflow.name] = [dataPoint]
                }
            }

    // 2
    let encodedOutput = try JSONEncoder
        .snakeCaseEncoder
        .encode(output)

    // 3
    if let prettyPrintedString = String(data: encodedOutput, encoding: .utf8) {
        print(prettyPrintedString)
    }
}
```

Let's break down the code:

1. The decoded data from Github's API's response is modified and [reduced into](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/reduce(into:_:)>) a more suitable format. The output type is an `Encodable` `struct` with two properties: **the name of the workflow** and a **set of data points** representing each of the runs associated with that workflow. In turn, each of the data points has the duration in seconds and the date when it was run.
2. The `Output` type is encoded into `Data` using a custom `JSONEncoder`. This encoder sets an output formatting type of `.prettyPrinted` to ensure data is easily readable by the application's users.
3. The data is converted into a `String` which can be printed to the console.

## Let's test it!

The application takes in a repository name and, if such repository is private, a bearer token with the necessary permissions:

```bash:Terminal
swift run GithubWorkflowMetrics pol-piella/reading-time
```

> [reading-time](https://github.com/pol-piella/reading-time) is an Open-Source public repository and, as such, it does not require a bearer token.

The command above yields the following result, which shows all runs for each workflow in the [reading-time](https://github.com/pol-piella/reading-time) repository with their date and duration in seconds ðŸŽ‰:

```json:Output.json
{
  "Windows" : [
    {
      "date" : "2022-10-02T20:55:24Z",
      "duration" : 430
    },
    {
      "date" : "2022-10-02T19:06:44Z",
      "duration" : 421
    },
    {
      "date" : "2022-10-02T17:55:37Z",
      "duration" : 391
    },
    {
      "date" : "2022-10-02T15:59:51Z",
      "duration" : 337
    },
    {
      "date" : "2022-10-02T15:48:38Z",
      "duration" : 355
    }
  ],
  "CI" : [
    {
      "date" : "2022-10-02T22:21:52Z",
      "duration" : 399
    },
    {
      "date" : "2022-10-02T22:14:18Z",
      "duration" : 438
    },
    {
      "date" : "2022-09-29T18:12:34Z",
      "duration" : 347
    },
    {
      "date" : "2022-09-29T17:04:53Z",
      "duration" : 522
    }
  ]
}
```
