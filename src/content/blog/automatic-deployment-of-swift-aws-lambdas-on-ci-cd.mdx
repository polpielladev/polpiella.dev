I have been using a Swift AWS lambda for a while now to automatically send a tweet whenever a new issue of the iOS CI Newsletter is sent to all subscribers.

The workflow is very simple: whenever the newsletter is sent to all subscribers, a webhook event is sent from the provider to the AWS lambda.

The lambda then uses the event's payload to send a tweet with the newsletter's title, the featured authors, the sponsor and the number of subscribers the email was sent to.

## Recent improvements

Up until recently, I was handling the deployment of the lambda manually. I was first building the lambda using the Swift Package command plugin provided by the [Swift AWS Lambda Runtime]() and then uploading the resulting .zip file to the AWS console.

This was a bit tedious and I wanted to automate the process. I also wanted to make sure that the lambda was always deployed with the latest version of the code.
