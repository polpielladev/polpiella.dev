Websites like GitHub provide ways of expanding their default behaviour through a set of automated messages which get sent when specific events happen called web hooks.

When you set up a webhook, you provide a URL to which GitHub sends a `POST` request with information on the subscribed to event as the body of the request.

GitHub has a set of web hooks you can subscribe to, such as the [issue_comment]() event, which gets called when a user adds a comment to a pull request or an issue on a repository.

In this article, you will learn how to write a serverless Swift function to listen to the [issue_comment]() web hook events and, if a pull request's comment's body matches the 'Upload to TestFlight' string, trigger an Xcode Cloud build which uploads the app for internal testing on TestFlight.

## Setting up the Amazon Web Services lambda

### Creating a Swift package

To create an Amazon Web Services lambda, you first need to create an executable Swift package:

```bash
# Create an empty directory
mkdir upload-to-testflight-webhook
# Move into the new directory
cd upload-to-testflight-webhook
# Create a new executable Swift package
swift package init --type executable --name UploadToTestFlightWebhook
```

The preceding command generates an executable Swift package with the following structure:

```bash
.
├── Package.swift
├── README.md
├── Sources
│   └── UploadToTestFlightWebhook
│       └── UploadToTestFlightWebhook.swift
└── Tests
    └── UploadToTestFlightWebhookTests
        └── UploadToTestFlightWebhookTests.swift
```

### Adding the dependencies

The [swift-server group]() provides a Swift package called [swift-aws-lambda-runtime]() to create Amazon Web Services lambdas using Swift.

The lambda needs to listen to `POST` requests sent by GitHub and, for this reason, needs to have an Amazon API Gateway as its trigger. To read data from the gateway's body, you need to add the [swift-aws-lambda-events]() package as a dependency.

```swift:Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.7

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "UploadToTestFlightWebhook",
    platforms: [.macOS(.v12)],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime.git", exact: "1.0.0-alpha.1"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-events.git", exact: "0.1.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "UploadToTestFlightWebhook",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "AWSLambdaRuntime", package: "swift-aws-lambda-runtime"),
                .product(name: "AWSLambdaEvents", package: "swift-aws-lambda-events")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

### Creating an empty lambda

To create an Amazon Web Services lambda which handles API Gateway events, you need to import both the `AWSLambdaRuntime` and `AWSLambdaEvents` packages and create a `@main` decorated `struct` which conforms to the `LambdaHandler` protocol.

```swift:Sources/UploadToTestFlightWebhook/UploadToTestFlightWebhook.swift
import AWSLambdaRuntime
import AWSLambdaEvents

@main
struct UploadToTestFlightWebhook: SimpleLambdaHandler {
    func handle(_ request: APIGatewayV2Request, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> APIGatewayV2Response {
        return .init(
            statusCode: .ok,
            body: "Hello World 👋"
        )
    }

}
```
