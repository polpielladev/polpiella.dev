Websites like GitHub provide ways of expanding their default behaviour through a set of automated messages which get sent when specific events happen called web hooks.

When you set up a webhook, you provide a URL to which GitHub sends a `POST` request with information on the subscribed to event as the body of the request.

GitHub has a set of web hooks you can subscribe to, such as the [issue_comment]() event, which gets called when a user adds a comment to a pull request or an issue on a repository.

In this article, you will learn how to write a serverless Swift function to listen to the [issue_comment]() web hook events and, if a pull request's comment's body matches the 'Upload to TestFlight' string, trigger an Xcode Cloud build which uploads the app for internal testing on TestFlight.
