It is that time of the year when music streaming services provide users with a recap of their most played songs and albums.

If you are an Apple music user, you will know that the service is no exception and you'll be familiar with its "Apple Music Replay" playlist that is frequently updated with your most played songs.

But what if you are a developer and want to get the user's most played Apple Music songs and albums and use the data in your app? Is that information accessible?

The answer is yes but it is not as straightforward as you might think.

## MusicKit vs MediaPlayer

When it comes to getting information about the user's music library such as the most played songs, you have two options: [MusicKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickit) and [MediaPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer).

As it stands, there is no method or endpoint to retrieve a list of the user's most played songs or albums using either framework. Instead, you need to manually get a list of all the songs or albums in the user's library and then apply some manual logic to filter and sort the results.

Both frameworks can achieve the same result but while [MusicKit]() is easier to use and requires less manual work from the developer's side, it seems to be slightly slower than [MediaPlayer]() in executing the queries.

If you're not too concerned about performance and value simplicity, I would thoroughly recommend using [MusicKit](), but I will show you how to use both frameworks in this article so you can decide which one is best for your use case.

## Getting the most played songs

Let's start by getting the most played songs in the user's library for a given year using both frameworks.

### Using MediaPlayer

```swift:MostPlayedService.swift
import MusicKit
import MediaPlayer

final class MostPlayedService {
    func getMostPlayedSongs(inYear year: Int, limit: Int = 5) async -> [Song] {
        // 1
        let query = MPMediaQuery.songs()
        guard let allSongs = query.items else { return [] }

        let topSongs = try? await allSongs
            // 2
            .filter { $0.mediaType == .music && $0.playCount > 0 && $0.lastPlayedDate?.year == year }
            // 3
            .sorted { $0.playCount > $1.playCount }
            // 4
            .prefix(limit)
            // 5
            .concurrentMap { await self.getSong(withID: $0.playbackStoreID) }
            .compactMap { $0 }

        return topSongs ?? []
    }

    private func getSong(withID id: String) async -> Song? {
        var songRequest = MusicCatalogResourceRequest<Song>(matching: \.id, equalTo: MusicItemID(id))
        songRequest.limit = 1
        songRequest.properties = [.albums]
        let response = try? await songRequest.response()
        return response?.items.first
    }
}
```

## Using MusicKit

```swift:MostPlayedService.swift
import MusicKit

final class MostPlayedService {
    func getMostPlayedSongs(inYear year: Int, limit: Int = 5) async -> [Song] {
        // 1
        var songRequest = MusicLibraryRequest<Song>()
        // 2
        songRequest.sort(by: \.playCount, ascending: false)
        // 3
        let response = try? await songRequest.response()

        let mostPlayedSongs = response?
            .items
            .map { musicItem in musicItem as Song }
            // 4
            .filter { song in (song.playCount ?? 0) > 0 && song.lastPlayedDate?.year == year }
            // 5
            .prefix(limit) ?? []

        return Array(mostPlayedSongs)
    }
}
```

## Getting the most played albums

Let's now see how to get the most played albums in the user's library for a given year using both frameworks. As you will see in the code snippets below, the process is slightly more complex than getting the most played songs as albums don't have `playCount` properties and we need to calculate the play count for each album by summing the play count of all the songs in the album.

### Using MediaPlayer

```swift:MostPlayedService.swift
import MusicKit
import MediaPlayer

final class MostPlayedService {
    func getMostPlayedAlbums(inYear year: Int, limit: Int = 5) async -> [Album] {
        // 1
        let query = MPMediaQuery.albums()
        guard let allAlbums = query.collections else { return [] }

        let mostPlayedAlbums = try? await allAlbums
            // 2
            .filter { $0.mediaTypes == .music }
            // 3
            .reduce(into: [String: Int](), { partialResult, collection in
                let wasAlbumPlayedInYear = collection.items
                    .map { $0.lastPlayedDate?.year == year }
                    .contains(true)

                guard let representativeItem = collection.representativeItem, wasAlbumPlayedInYear else {
                    return
                }

                let playCount = collection.items.reduce(into: 0) { partialResult, item in
                    if item.lastPlayedDate?.year == year { partialResult += item.playCount }
                }
                partialResult[representativeItem.playbackStoreID] = playCount
            })
            // 4
            .filter { _, playCount in playCount > 0 }
            // 5
            .sorted { lhs, rhs in lhs.1 > rhs.1 }
            // 6
            .map { songID, _ in songID }
            // 7
            .prefix(limit)
            // 8
            .concurrentMap { songID in await self.getSong(withID: songID) }
            // 9
            .compactMap(\.?.albums?.first)

        return mostPlayedAlbums ?? []
    }
}
```

### Using MusicKit

```swift:MostPlayedService.swift
import MusicKit

final class MostPlayedService {
    func getMostPlayedAlbums(inYear year: Int, limit: Int = 5) async -> [Album] {
        // 1
        let response = try? await MusicLibraryRequest<Album>().response()

        let mostPlayedAlbums = response?.items
            .map { musicItem in musicItem as Album }
            // 2
            .compactMap { album -> (album: Album, playCount: Int)? in
                let playCount = album.tracks?.reduce(into: 0, { playCount, track in
                    if track.lastPlayedDate?.year == year {
                        playCount += track.playCount ?? 0
                    }
                }) ?? 0
                guard playCount > 0, album.lastPlayedDate?.year == year else { return nil }

                return (album: album, playCount: playCount)
            }
            // 3
            .sorted { lhs, rhs in lhs.playCount > rhs.playCount }
            // 4
            .prefix(limit)
            // 5
            .map(\.album) ?? []

        return mostPlayedAlbums
    }
}
```
