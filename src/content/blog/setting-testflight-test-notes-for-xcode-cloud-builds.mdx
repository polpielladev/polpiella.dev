During the [Simplify distribution in Xcode and Xcode Cloud WWDC23 session](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10224) [Chris D'Angelo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-d-angelo-91469163/) and Jason Wu from the Xcode team introduced a new Xcode Cloud feature that allows you to set TestFlight test notes for beta builds.

This is a **long-awaited** feature by many Xcode Cloud users including myself and it is going to help developers **streamline their beta deployment processes** even further with Xcode Cloud.

## Setting test notes

As part of the TestFlight deployment process, Xcode Cloud now inspects the root of the project's directory and looks for files with the name `WhatToTest.<LOCALE>.txt` inside a directory with the name `TestFlight`. For each of the files matching the pattern, Xcode Cloud uses the file's contents to set the test notes for each locale.

It is important to note that you **must provide a separate file for each locale you want to support** and **strictly follow the name convention**. You can find [a list of supported locales in Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/betabuildlocalizationcreaterequest/data/attributes#discussion).

I have spent some time adopting this new feature for my app QReate and I am going to show you how I have added **autogenerated and auto-translated test notes** for English (Great Britain and the United States), Spanish (Spain) and French (France) locales.

### Creating the files

I first created a `TestFlight` directory at the root of my project and added a file for each English-speaking locale I wanted to support:

```bash:Terminal
# Create the TestFlight directory
mkdir TestFlight
# Create a file for each locale
for locale in en-GB en-US; do
  echo "Bug fixes and improvements" > TestFlight/WhatToTest.$locale.txt
done
```

The terminal command above created the following directory structure, which matched the one expected by Xcode Cloud:

```bash:Directory
QReate
â”œâ”€â”€ TestFlight
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WhatToTest.en-GB.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WhatToTest.en-US.txt
```

### Running the workflow

Now that I had the first two files in place, I committed them to source control and then ran my `TestFlight` workflow, which uploads a new build to TestFlight for external testing, to verify everything worked as expected.

After the workflow finished executing, I checked App Store Connect and saw that the test notes had been set correctly for both locales:

## Automatically generating test notes

While setting the test notes manually worked, I wanted to automate and streamline the process further by:

1. Automatically generating the test notes from the repository's git log history.
2. Automatically translating the test notes to other languages. As I said at the beginning of the article, I wanted to also support Spanish and French test notes.

Luckily, Xcode Cloud has a feature called [CI Scripts that allows you to run custom scripts and actions at different stages of the workflow](https://www.polpiella.dev/xcode-cloud-scripts-fastlane-and-cocoapods).

I used this feature to create a `ci_post_xcodebuild.sh` script which is executed after the app is archived and generates and translates the test notes for all supported locales:

```bash:ci_post_xcodebuild.sh
#!/bin/sh

if [[ $CI_WORKFLOW == "TestFlight" ]]; then
  pushd ..
    mkdir TestFlight
    pushd TestFlight
      for locale in en-GB en-US; do
        git fetch --deepen 3 && git log -3 --pretty=format:"%s" > WhatToTest.$locale.txt
      done
    popd
  popd
fi
```

> **Disclaimer**: I used the logic described by [Apple in their documentation to generate test notes automatically from the repository's last three commits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/including-notes-for-testers-with-a-beta-release-of-your-app#Write-a-script-to-generate-content-dynamically) but I extended it and modified it to show how you can support multiple locales with minimal effort (as you will see in the following sections).

### Automatic translation

I then used the AI-backed [Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) to translate the generated notes automatically into Spanish and French.

I created a small Swift command-line tool that takes in a String, a source and a target language and makes a network request to [Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) to get the translated notes:

```swift:Translate.swift
import ArgumentParser
import Foundation

struct TranslateResponse: Codable {
    let data: DataModel
}

struct DataModel: Codable {
    let translations: [Translation]
}

struct Translation: Codable {
    let translatedText: String
}

@main
struct ReleaseNotesTranslator: AsyncParsableCommand {
    @Argument(help: "The text to be translated")
    var text: String

    @Argument(help: "The source language code")
    var source: String

    @Argument(help: "The target language code")
    var target: String


    func run() async throws {
        guard let apiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] else {
            fatalError("Missing `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable")
        }

        var urlComponents = URLComponents(string: "https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2")!
        urlComponents.queryItems = [
            .init(name: "q", value: text),
            .init(name: "source", value: source),
            .init(name: "target", value: target),
            .init(name: "format", value: "text"),
            .init(name: "key", value: apiKey)
        ]

        var request = URLRequest(url: urlComponents.url!)
        request.httpMethod = "POST"

        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
        let response = try JSONDecoder().decode(TranslateResponse.self, from: data)

        guard let translatedText = response.data.translations.first?.translatedText else {
            fatalError("Could not retrieve a translation")
        }

        print(translatedText)
    }
}
```

I then archived the code into a universal Apple binary (with `x86_64` and `arm64` architecture slices), committed it to source control and used it in my `ci_post_xcodebuild.sh` script to translate the originally generated test notes into Spanish and French:

```bash:ci_post_xcodebuild.sh
#!/bin/sh

if [[ $CI_WORKFLOW == "TestFlight" ]]; then
  pushd ..
    mkdir TestFlight
    pushd TestFlight
      git fetch --deepen 3 && git log -3 --pretty=format:"%s" > WhatToTestSample.txt
      for locale in en-GB en-US; do
        cat WhatToTestSample.txt > WhatToTest.$locale.txt
      done

      # Translate the notes for each locale
      for locale in es-ES fr-FR; do
        language_code=$(echo $locale | cut -d- -f1)
        # Path to the compiled executable
        ./../release-notes-translator "$(cat WhatToTestSample.txt)" en $language_code > WhatToTest.$locale.txt
      done
      rm -rf WhatToTestSample.txt
    popd
  popd
fi
```

> Note that the executable I made to translate release notes made use of an environment variable called `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, which I had to define as a secret in the Xcode Cloud workflow's environment settings.

After running the workflow, I could see that the test notes had been generated and set correctly for all locales:

## Compatibility

Xcode Cloud is deeply integrated with Xcode but **it is not an Xcode feature**. This means that you do not need Xcode to create, manage and run Xcode Cloud workflows. You can achieve the same result **through the App Store Connect dashboard** or by **making network requests to the App Store Connect API**.

What this means is that while these changes were announced during WWDC23, they **do not require Xcode 15 to work**. You can run your workflows from Xcode 14 with the changes described in this article and they will work in the same way as they would in Xcode 15! ðŸŽ‰
