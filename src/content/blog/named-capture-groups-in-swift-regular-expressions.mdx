I have recently been working on a new feature for my app [QReate](https://getqreate.app) that will allow users to create different kinds of QR codes from a set of templates.

This feature is essentially a way of formatting and displaying the content of a QR code in a more user-friendly way.

## WIFI URLs

The first template I will be adding to the app is the WIFI URL one. WIFI URLs are used in QR codes to allow users to easily connect to a WIFI network by scanning the QR code.

The format of such URLs looks like this:

```bash:ExampleWifiURL
WIFI:S:wifinetwork;T:WPA;P:password;;
```

The URL above defines the required information to join the WIFI network through a number of key-value pairs:

1. S: The SSID of the WIFI network. This is a **required field**.
2. T: The type of security used by the WIFI network. This is an **optional field**. It can be one of the following values: WEP, WPA, WPA2, or nopass.
3. P: The password of the WIFI network. This is a **required field**. If the WIFI network does not require a password, this field should be empty.
4. H: The hidden status of the WIFI network. This is an **optional field**. If not specified, the WIFI network is assumed to be a visible network and the H field will be empty or `FALSE`.

> Note that this is how I defined my schema in the app and I have made fields that are optional to make the client-side experience better.

## Regex: Extracting information

After a lot of fighting with regular expressions, I was able to come up with one that did the job of extracting the right information from the WIFI URL:

```bash:WifiRegex
WIFI:S:(?<ssid>[^;]+);(?:T:(?<security>[^;]*);)?P:(?<password>[^;]+);(?:H:(?<hidden>[^;]*);)?;
```

The regular expression above has a set of capture groups for each of the values, taking optionality into account based on whether the keys are required or not.

The thing I learnt while working on this feature and that made my life a lot easier is that you can name capture groups to later retrieve them more nicely from your code.

In the next couple of sections, I will show you how to do this in Swift in two different ways: using `NSRegularExpression` and using `SwiftRegex`.

### iOS 16+: Using SwiftRegex

SwiftRegex is a relatively new API introduced in iOS 16 that allows you to write and use regular expressions in a more Swift-friendly way.

There are two ways you can build a regular expression using SwiftRegex:

1. Using Regex literals.
2. Using `RegexBuilder`'s result builders.

#### Using Regex literals

You can define a Regex literal by wrapping a regular expression in forward slashes:

```swift:SwiftRegex.swift
import Foundation

let regex = /WIFI:S:(?<ssid>[^;]+);(?:T:(?<security>[^;]*);)?P:(?<password>[^;]+);(?:H:(?<hidden>[^;]*);)?;/
```

You can then retrieve the whole match in the string you are matching against using the `.wholeMatch` method and retrieve the named captured groups directly:

```swift:SwiftRegex.swift
let wifi = "WIFI:S:superwificonnection;T:WPA;P:strongpassword;;"

if let result = try? regex.wholeMatch(in: wifi) {
    print("SSID: \(result.ssid)")
    print("Security: \(result.security)")
    print("Password: \(result.password)")
}
```

#### Result builders

This is by far my favourite way of writing regular expressions in Swift. The `RegexBuilder` APIs allow you to compose a regular expression using a set of result builders that make the code a lot more readable and maintainable.

```swift:RegexBuilder.swift
import RegexBuilder

let ssid = Reference(Substring.self)
let password = Reference(Substring.self)
let security = Reference(Substring.self)
let hidden = Reference(Substring.self)

let regex = Regex {
  "WIFI:S:"
  Capture(as: ssid) {
      OneOrMore(CharacterClass.anyOf(";").inverted)
  }
  ";"
  Optionally {
    Regex {
      "T:"
      Capture(as: security) {
        ZeroOrMore(CharacterClass.anyOf(";").inverted)
      }
      ";"
    }
  }
  "P:"
  Capture(as: password) {
    OneOrMore(CharacterClass.anyOf(";").inverted)
  }
  ";"
  Optionally {
    Regex {
      "H:"
      Capture(as: hidden) {
        ZeroOrMore(CharacterClass.anyOf(";").inverted)
      }
      ";"
    }
  }
  ";"
}
.anchorsMatchLineEndings()
```

You can then use the same `wholeMatch` method you used in the previous section and retrieve the values from the named capture groups through the reference properties:

```swift:RegexBuilder.swift
let wifi = "WIFI:S:superwificonnection;T:WPA;P:strongpassword;;"

if let result = try? regex.wholeMatch(in: wifi) {
    print("SSID: \(result[ssid])")
    print("Security: \(result[security])")
    print("Password: \(result[password])")
}
```

### Using NSRegularExpression

`NSRegularExpression` is an alternative API you can use if you still need to support versions older than iOS 16. This API has been around for a while and is widely supported across all Apple platforms. The only downside to it is that it is far more cumbersome to use and it is more error-prone.

You can start by instantiating a new `NSRegularExpression` object and pass it the same regular expression we defined earlier as its pattern:

```swift:NSRegularExpression.swift
import Foundation

let regex = try! NSRegularExpression(
    pattern: #"WIFI:S:(?<ssid>[^;]+);(?:T:(?<security>[^;]*);)?P:(?<password>[^;]+);(?:H:(?<hidden>[^;]*);)?;"#,
    options: []
)
```

You can then get the first match from the string using the `firstMatch` method and then retrieve all capture groups by name:

```swift:NSRegularExpression.swift
import Foundation

let wifi = "WIFI:S:superwificonnection;T:WPA;P:strongpassword;;"

let range = NSRange(wifi.startIndex..<wifi.endIndex, in: wifi)
guard let match = regex.firstMatch(in: wifi, options: [], range: range) else {
    fatalError()
}

if let ssidRange = Range(match.range(withName: "ssid"), in: wifi),
    let passwordRange = Range(match.range(withName: "password"), in: wifi)  {
    let security: String? = {
        guard let range = Range(match.range(withName: "security"), in: wifi) else { return nil }
        return String(wifi[range])
    }()
    let hidden: String? = {
        guard let range = Range(match.range(withName: "hidden"), in: wifi) else { return nil }
        return String(wifi[range])
    }()

    print("SSID: \(wifi[ssidRange])")
    print("Password: \(wifi[passwordRange])")
    print("Security: \(security ?? "not set")")
    print("Hidden: \(hidden ?? "not set")")
}
```
