Xcode 15 introduces a way of automatically performing accessibility audits on your app through UI tests. Such audits can help you identify accessibility issues in your app such as missing labels, clipped text, insufficient colour contrast, lack of support for Dynamic Type and many more.

> If you want to learn more about everything the new audits can catch, please refer to [Apple's documentation on the topic]() and [the great session from this year's WWDC]().

Before Xcode 15, there was no first-party API to do this and you had to rely on some brilliant third-party libraries such as [Rob Whitaker's A11yUITests](https://github.com/rwapp/A11yUITests) or [Cash App's AccessibilitySnapshot](https://github.com/cashapp/AccessibilitySnapshot).

## The demo app

I have made a small demo app that has several accessibility issues:

1. The app does not scale with dynamic type and only uses the default font size.
2. The 'Go to checkout' button at the bottom of the screen's title does not have sufficient colour contrast.
3. The small cart icons next to each item do not have a big enough hit region.
4. The price labels are not read correctly by VoiceOver.

## How do audits work?

The new API is exposed as a method called `performAccessibilityAudit()` on `XCUIApplication`. What this means is that to perform an audit you need to have UI tests set up for your target and you need to call the new method from within one of those tests.

### Running an audit

In the app's UI tests target, let's create a new class that inherits from `XCTestCase` and add a test method that launches the app and calls the new method:

```swift:AccessibilityAuditsUITests.swift
import XCTest

final class AccessibilityAuditsUITests: XCTestCase {
    func testAccessibilityAudits() throws {
        let app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launch()

        try app.performAccessibilityAudit()
    }
}
```

Running the audit is then as simple as just running the test we've just created.

### Viewing the results

If the audit has found no accessibility issues for your app, the test will pass and you will see a green checkmark in the Report navigator. On the other hand, if the audit encounters any issues at all, it will fail and you will be able to see why in the Report navigator.

For my demo app, the audit fails with several errors that I listed earlier in the article, which are listed in the tests section of the latest test run in the local Report navigator:

![]()

The new accessibility audit feature, paired with the excellent new test reports, makes it very easy to identify and fix accessibility issues in your app.

You can double-click on any of the issues to see more details about it, including a video of the test run that failed, a screenshot of the app at the time of the failure and a close-up of the element that failed the audit! ðŸŽ‰

### Narrowing down the audit scope

If you're not interested in auditing every kind of accessibility issue in your app, you can narrow down the scope by passing a list of `XCUIAccessibilityAuditType`s to the `performAccessibilityAudit()` method.

For example, the method below would only check the app for insufficient colour contrast and lack of support for Dynamic Type:

```swift:AccessibilityAuditsUITests.swift
import XCTest

final class AccessibilityAuditsUITests: XCTestCase {
    func testAccessibilityAudits() throws {
        // UI tests must launch the application that they test.
        let app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launch()

        try app.performAccessibilityAudit(for: [.contrast, .dynamicType])
    }
}
```

### Ignoring specific issues

Let's say there are some known issues in your app that you're aware of and that you don't want the audit to flag.

You can skip specific issues using the second parameter of the `performAccessibilityAudit()` method, which is a closure that has a `XCUIAccessibilityAuditIssue` as its only parameter and returns a `Bool` indicating whether the issue should be ignored or not.

For example, the code below ignores the dynamic type issues for the button only in the demo app:

```swift:AccessibilityAuditsUITests.swift
import XCTest

final class AccessibilityAuditsUITests: XCTestCase {
    func testAccessibilityAudits() throws {
        // UI tests must launch the application that they test.
        let app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launch()

        try app.performAccessibilityAudit(for: [.contrast, .dynamicType]) { issue in
            guard let element = issue.element, element.label == "Go to checkout" else {
                return false
            }

            return issue.auditType == .dynamicType
        }
    }
}
```

## Bonus track: CI/CD

As you can do for building and archiving the app, you can also run the UI tests where your accessibility audits are performed from the command line and, by extension, from your CI/CD pipeline.

To do so, you need to call the test command on `xcodebuild` with the desired environment. I would personally recommend overriding the derivded data path to a local directory so that you have easy access to the test output:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project YourApp.xcodeproj \
  -scheme AccessibilityAudits \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14,OS=17.0' \
  -derivedDataPath derived_data \
  test
```

You can then find the output `xcresult` bundle at `derived_data/Logs/Test/*.xcresult`. You can open this bundle in Xcode to inspect the results.
