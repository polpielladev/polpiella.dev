I recently decided to spend some time automating the release process for [NowPlaying](https://nowplaying.page) and make **shipping new versions of the app as simple as possible**.

I decided to use Xcode Cloud as our CI/CD solution due to its **tight integration with Xcode and App Store Connect** and the fact that, as we have an Apple Developer Membership, we would get a tier of 25 compute hours per month **at no extra cost**!

At the moment, NowPlaying has two targets that we ship to the App Store regularly - one for iOS and one for tvOS. I wanted to create a solution that would allow us to **specify which platform** we want to release and have the workflow take care of the rest.

## Defining the workflow

While I am taking an iterative approach to the automation and there are things I still want to improve, the workflow I settled on works in the following way:

1. We manually create a tag in the repository that specifies the **version number** and **platform** we want to ship: `iOS/<version>` or `visionOS/<version>`.
2. Once the tag is pushed, **a workflow for the specific platform is triggered**.
3. Before the app is built, the workflow sets the `MARKETING_VERSION` property of all relevant targets for the specified platform to the version number in the tag.
4. Changes are **committed and pushed** to the `main` branch of the repository.
5. The app is **built and distributed** to TestFlight using Xcode Cloud.

## The iOS Workflow

I started setting up the iOS workflow and all of its steps and information, which I will go through in this section.

In the general information section, I specified which **repository and project** to use, as well as checked the 'Restrict Editing' box.

The latter is **required** for workflows that upload builds for external testing:

Then, I added a GitHub token with push permissions to the environment variables section and marked it as a secret. This token will be used later on in the workflow to push the version update changes to the repository:

![](/assets/posts/cross-platform-app-releases-with-xcode-cloud/ios-environment.webp)

The workflow has a single start condition - **when a tag is created**. I specified that the workflow should only run when the tag name is prefixed with `iOS/`:

![](/assets/posts/cross-platform-app-releases-with-xcode-cloud/ios-tag-changes.webp)

The workflow only has a single action that **archives the app for iOS** and **prepares it for external testing and distribution** to the App Store:

![](/assets/posts/cross-platform-app-releases-with-xcode-cloud/ios-archive.webp)

Last but not least, the workflow needs to upload the build to TestFlight and add it to any relevant groups of beta testers:

## The visionOS Workflow

Both the iOS and visionOS workflows are very similar, so I will only highlight the main differences between the two you need to be aware of.

First, instead of specifying the `iOS/` prefix for the tag, I specified `visionOS/`:

![](/assets/posts/cross-platform-app-releases-with-xcode-cloud/visionos-tag-changes.webp)

And in the `Archive` action, I changed the scheme and platform to the visionOS target:

![](/assets/posts/cross-platform-app-releases-with-xcode-cloud/visionos-archive.webp)

## Setting up Fastlane

Now that the Xcode Cloud workflow was ready, I needed to create a script that would set the `MARKETING_VERSION` property of the relevant targets to the version number in the tag.

I decided to use fastlane for this as it is a tool I am familiar with and it provides a lot of actions that make it easy to automate numerous tasks.

To install fastlane, I decided to use Ruby's `Bundler` so that I could manage all dependencies and easily install them on CI:

```bash:Terminal
bundle init
```

The command above created a `Gemfile` at the root of the repository that I then edited to include the `fastlane` and `xcodeproj` gems and support loading fastlane plugins:

```ruby:Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "fastlane"
gem "xcodeproj"

plugins_path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'fastlane', 'Pluginfile')
eval_gemfile(plugins_path) if File.exist?(plugins_path)
```

Now, after running the `bundle install` command, I had fastlane available locally, so I could then initialize the fastlane project by running the `bundle exec fastlane init` command.

I also installed a plugin to help me check the `git status` for specific files to then decide on whether to commit changes or not:

```bash:Terminal
bundle exec fastlane add_plugin fastlane-plugin-git_status
```

## Writing the script

The first thing I did after initializing the fastlane project was to create a new lane in the `FastFile` with some logic to read the value of the tag, set the `MARKETING_VERSION` property of the relevant targets and commit the changes to the repository:

```ruby:Fastfile
fastlane_require 'xcodeproj'

# 1
def set_all_xcodeproj_version_numbers(version_number, platform)
  project = Xcodeproj::Project.open('../NowPlaying.xcodeproj')
  targets = project.targets
  if platform == "ios"
    targets = targets.select { |target| target.name != "NowPlayingTests" && target.name != "NowPlaying visionOS" }
  else
    targets = targets.select { |target| target.name == "NowPlaying visionOS" } if platform == "visionOS"
  end

  targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings["MARKETING_VERSION"] = version_number
    end
  end
  project.save
end

desc "Description of what the lane does"
lane :bump_version do
  # 2
  split_git_ref = ENV["CI_TAG"].split("/", -1)
  version_number = split_git_ref.last
  platform = split_git_ref.first
  # 3
  set_all_xcodeproj_version_numbers(version_number, platform.downcase)
  # 4
  if git_status(path: "NowPlaying.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj").empty?
    puts "ðŸš€ Nothing to commit, pushing the same version again!"
  else
    sh("git fetch origin main:main")
    sh("git checkout main")

    git_commit(path: "NowPlaying.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj", message: "[ðŸš€ release #{platform}] Updating version to: #{version_number}")

    # Push with personal access token to enable permissions in Xcode Cloud
    sh("git push https://polpielladev:#{ENV["GITHUB_TOKEN"]}@github.com/hiddevdploeg/NowPlaying.git")
  end
end
```

Let's go through the lane I created step by step:

1. I created a method called `set_all_xcodeproj_version_numbers` that takes the version number and the platform as arguments. This method opens the `NowPlaying.xcodeproj` file and sets the `MARKETING_VERSION` property of all relevant targets to the version number. The `platform` argument is used to determine which targets to update.
2. I then created a lane called `bump_version` that reads the value of the tag using Xcode Cloud's `CI_TAG` environment variable and uses it to retrieve the version and platform.
3. The new lane then calls `set_all_xcodeproj_version_numbers` method with the version number and platform as arguments.
4. Finally the lane checks if the `NowPlaying.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file has been modified and, if so, commits the changes to the repository and pushes them to the `main` branch using the GitHub token I added to the environment variables in the Xcode Cloud workflow. If the file has not been modified, the lane prints a message to the console and exits.

Once the lane was ready, I added a new file called `ci_post_clone.sh` in a new `ci_scripts` directory at the root of the repository. This file is executed by Xcode Cloud straight after the repository is cloned and before the actions start.

```bash:ci_post_clone.sh
#!/bin/sh

cd ..

echo 'export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems' >>~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bash_profile
export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems
export PATH="$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH"

gem install bundler --install-dir $GEM_HOME

bundle install

bundle exec fastlane bump_version
```

The script installs all dependencies using `Bundler` and then calls the `bump_version` lane I created in the `FastFile`.

## Future improvements

There are a couple of things I would like the workflow to do in the future:

- Automatically update the release notes based on a local file in the repository and handle translations automatically, [as I do in this article on my blog](https://www.polpiella.dev/setting-testflight-test-notes-for-xcode-cloud-builds).
- Create a new release in GitHub with the release notes and the tag.

I will keep iterating on this automation and will update the article with any new improvements I make, so make sure to keep an eye on my social media to not miss any updates!
