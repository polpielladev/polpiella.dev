I recently made a small Swift command-line tool that would use [MusicKit]() to gather information about one or more songs based on user input.

If you have ever used [MusicKit](), you will know that the first prerequisite is to create an app identifier in the Apple Developer portal and give it the right capabilities.

But how can you do this for a command-line tool that has no `Info.plist` or bundle identifiers? Are you able to use MusicKit at all? The answer is yes, and in this article, I will show you exactly how!
