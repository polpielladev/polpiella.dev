A couple of weeks ago I gave a talk about how to gain confidence in your release process at the [Mobile Devops Summit](https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit), a remote event organised by [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io). Off the back of it, I thought it would be a good idea to write an article going into the specifics of the talk and the motivation behind it.

## Motivation

As an iOS developer, there are certain CI pipelines which are crucial to the delivery of an app but, because of their nature, they are not run frequently. A great example of this is a release pipeline, which automates archiving an application, signing it and submitting it to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) and is only run when the app is ready for release.

When a pipeline is not run often, any issues with it will go unnoticed and will only creep up when the pipeline is next needed. While some of theses issues are trivial to fix, you want these kind of processes to go as smoothly as possible and, in the case of a release pipeline, gain confidence that the app will go out to users in a swift manner, rather than having to spend time fixing errors.

Let's take a look over the following sections at two different errors that can happen on release day and can certainly be tricky to debug.

### Archiving errors

Build errors are easy to spot as an app is usually built on the CI numerous times every day. On the other hand, there are some errors which are specific to archiving an application, a process that usually only happens when we need to generate an artifact which then needs to be distributed.

Let's consider a modular iOS application which defines iOS 15 as the minimum deployment version. We want to introduce a new feature which is built entirely with SwiftUI, so we create a new module called `Schedule` (as a Swift package):

```swift:Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.6
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Schedule",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "Schedule",
            targets: ["Schedule"]
        )
    ],
    dependencies: [],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "Schedule",
            dependencies: []
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "ScheduleTests",
            dependencies: ["Schedule"]
        )
    ]
)
```

The new module is then imported by the application target and displayed when needed. The app can be built, the tests run fine and the new view looks great, the app is now using SwiftUI! ðŸŽ‰

Time goes by and the next release day comes along, with a lot of excitement on getting feedback from users on that new view. But as soon as the release pipeline is run, there is an error related to archiving the application:

![A screenshot of the app's build logs showing a failure on archive.](/assets/posts/testing-your-release-pipeline-using-fastlane/archive-error.jpg)

Looking at the build log above, it looks like the app is being archived for `armv7`. The problem here is that SwiftUI is not available on the `armv7` SDKs, which is causing the compiler to not find any SwiftUI symbols. After looking at some related [Apple Developer Forum threads](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/690405), it seemed that if an app has a minimum deployment version of iOS 11 or higher, it should not be built for that architecture.

So what's happening? Well, after multiple attempts at fixing the error, it turns out that even though the new package is being imported by a target with a minimum deployment version of iOS 15, a minimum iOS version needs to be set under `platforms` in the `Package.swift` to make the error go away:

```swift:Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.6
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Schedule",
    platforms: [
        .iOS(.v15)
    ],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "Schedule",
            targets: ["Schedule"]
        )
    ],
    dependencies: [],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "Schedule",
            dependencies: []
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "ScheduleTests",
            dependencies: ["Schedule"]
        )
    ]
)
```

> Note that this error seems to be specific to Xcode 13 and does not seem to be a problem on Xcode 14.

### Upload errors

Now that we've seen an archive error, let's take a look at an example of an upload error. Let's consider now that the new SwiftUI module is a framework instead (in an Xcode project) and is used by different targets. Each of these embeds and signs the framework.

The app builds, runs and archives without any issues but as soon as it is uploaded it to App Store Connect, an error occurs:

![A screenshot of an error occurring when uploading to App Store Connect. The issue is that the app contains duplicated bundles, which is not allowed](/assets/posts/testing-your-release-pipeline-using-fastlane/upload-error.jpg)

By embedding and signing multiple times, we're creating duplicate copies of the same bundle, which causes an upload error. This is due to the fact that there can't be more than one bundle with the same identifier. The fix is straightforward but can sometimes be hard to spot if you're new to modularised codebases. To get around this, the framework should be embedded and signed only once at the app target's level and then any other target which uses it should choose to not embed it.

## Catching these errors early

Even though the issues above did not require major code changes, they did certainly take a while to diagnose and investigate. And that is time that you are delaying your release by. This might not be a big deal if your release only includes new features and improvements but think of a situation where you're doing a patch release which fixes a major crash, you certainly want your app to go out to users as quickly as possible.

It is important to note that this article does not show you how to prevent these issues from occurring but rather helps you spot them early, so you have time to fix them ahead of the next release. The issue with testing these kind of pipelines is that they can be quite cumbersome and lengthy and, to take up a lot of CI resources and time during the team's working hours would cause disruption. Here is where scheduled CI runs come in very handy.

The idea behind them is that you can schedule your pipeline to be run at a specific date and time recurringly using [cron expressions](https://crontab.guru). In the following sections, I will build a Github Action which will archive the app, sign it for the App Store and then verify the binary with [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) using [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools).

## Implementing a nightly Github action

### Creating a nightly lane

Let's get started by reviewing what the release lane looks like in the [Fastfile](https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/Fastfile/):

```ruby:Fastfile
lane :release do
  # Let's make some magic happen ðŸª„
  gym(
    project: "./NutriFit.xcodeproj",
    clean: true,
    derived_data_path: "./derived-data",
    output_directory: "./build",
    output_name: "NutriFit.ipa",
    scheme: "NutriFit",
    export_options: {
      provisioningProfiles: {
        "dev.polpiella.NutriFit" => "NutriFit App Store",
      }
    }
  )

  deliver(
    ipa: "build/Nutrifit.ipa"
  )
end
```

By looking at the errors encountered above, the new `nightly` lane needs to verify that the app can be archived correctly and that the binary produced can be uploaded to App Store Connect. The problem is that if we duplicate the release's lane code verbatim it will submit a build to TestFlight, which is not what we want. Instead, we should use deliver's `verify_only` flag so that the build is never submitted, only verified:

```ruby:Fastfile
lane :release do
  # Let's make some magic happen ðŸª„
  gym(
    project: "./NutriFit.xcodeproj",
    clean: true,
    derived_data_path: "./derived-data",
    output_directory: "./build",
    output_name: "NutriFit.ipa",
    scheme: "NutriFit",
    export_options: {
      provisioningProfiles: {
        "dev.polpiella.NutriFit" => "NutriFit App Store",
      }
    }
  )

  deliver(
    ipa: "build/Nutrifit.ipa",
    verify_only: true
  )
end
```

> If you want to find out more about how the `verify_only` flag works under the hood, you can take a look at the [original pull request](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/20247). I worked on making this code change, so if you have any further questions feel free to drop me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/polpielladev).

### Creating a nightly workflow

Now that the nightly lane is implemented, it needs to be run at a given time every day. To achieve this, a new [Github Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) file called `nightly.yml`, which runs on a system with macos-latest as its operating system and just calls the nightly lane on the repo, is created under the `.github/workflows` directory. On top of this, the action below uses a `schedule` tag with a chron expression to tell Github this action needs to run every day at midnight:

```yml:nightly.yml
name: Nightly

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  nightly:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run nightly lane
      run: bundle exec fastlane nightly
```

> There is some extra setup such as authentication with App Store Connect that has been ignored in this article for the sake of simplicity. If you are interested in learning a bit more about how to handle authentication with App Store Connect and fastlane, keep an eye on this blog as I will write an article on the topic soon.

## When scheduled workflows shine

Scheduled workflows come in very handy when you want to gain confidence in processes which are very important but donâ€™t get run very often (e.g. release pipeline).

They are also great at performing time and resource consuming tasks (such as end to end tests) with minimal disruption and cost. For example, instead of running E2E tests on every push to main, they can be run once in the evening, testing all changes from the day.

Last but not least, another great use case of scheduled CI runs is automating repetitive processes. As an example, at work we have a certificate which needs to be issued every month, so we created a Github action which runs at the beginning of each month and replaces the current certificate with a freshly issued one.
