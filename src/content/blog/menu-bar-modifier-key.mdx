Menu bar items are a great way to provide quick access to your macOS app's features. In fact, there are many apps that rely solely on a menu bar item to provide all or most of their app's functionality.

A common pattern in macOS apps is to provide different functionality or appearance based on whether the user clicked on the item with a modifier key pressed or not. Commonly, apps check if the `Option` key modifier is pressed when clicking on a menu bar item and usually either show a menu instead of launching the app directly or show hidden options in the same menu. 

This pattern is not only used by third-party apps like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) but is also used by Apple's own first-party systems like the Volume menu bar item:

In this article, I will show you how you can achieve this behavior using both AppKit and SwiftUI.

## AppKit

In an AppKit app, you can achieve this by implementing [the menuWillOpen method from the NSMenuDelegate protocol in your app's AppDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsmenudelegate). In this method, which will get called whenever the popover is about to open, you can check if the modifier key is pressed and modify the menu accordingly:

```swift:NSApplicationDelegate.swift
import AppKit

final class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
    var statusBar: NSStatusBar!
    var statusBarItem: NSStatusItem!
    var hiddenSetting: NSMenuItem!
    
    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        statusBar = NSStatusBar()
        statusBarItem = statusBar.statusItem(withLength: NSStatusItem.variableLength)
        
        if let button = statusBarItem.button {
            button.image = NSImage(systemSymbolName: "figure.fencing", accessibilityDescription: nil)
            
            // Hidden Item
            let hiddenSetting = NSMenuItem()
            hiddenSetting.title = "ü§ê Hidden Setting"
            hiddenSetting.target = self
            hiddenSetting.action = #selector(hiddenSettingCalled)
            self.hiddenSetting = hiddenSetting
            
            // Menu
            let mainMenu = NSMenu()
            mainMenu.addItem(withTitle: "New Game", action: #selector(newGame), keyEquivalent: "N")
            mainMenu.addItem(hiddenSetting)
            mainMenu.addItem(.separator())
            mainMenu.addItem(withTitle: "Quit", action: #selector(quit), keyEquivalent: "Q")
            
            mainMenu.delegate = self
            
            statusBarItem.menu = mainMenu
        }
    }

    // ...
}

extension AppDelegate: NSMenuDelegate {
    func menuWillOpen(_ menu: NSMenu) {
        hiddenSetting.isHidden = !NSEvent.modifierFlags.contains(.option)
    }
}
```

## SwiftUI

In a SwiftUI app, you can achieve the same behavior by checking the modifier key when `MenuBarExtra`'s content view is rendered. Unfortunately, the `onAppear` modifier only gets called when the view is first rendered when using the default `.menu` `menuBarExtraStyle`. To work around this, you can use the `.window` `menuBarExtraStyle`, which will render the view in a window and call the `onAppear` modifier every time the window is shown:

```swift:MenuBarExtra.swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct MenuBarModifierKeyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        
        MenuBarExtra("Fency McFencer", systemImage: "figure.fencing") {
            MenuBarView()
        }
        .menuBarExtraStyle(.window)
    }
}
```

In the `MenuBarView`, which will get rendered every time the menu bar item is clicked, you can check if a modifier key is pressed in the `onAppear` modifier and, if it is, update a `@State` property to change the view's appearance:

```swift:MenuBarView.swift
import SwiftUI

struct MenuBarView: View {
    @State private var showHiddenItems = false
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // ...
        }
        .padding()
        .onAppear {
            showHiddenItems = NSEvent.modifierFlags.contains(.option)
        }
    }
}
```
