## Xcode Cloud webhooks

Xcode Cloud has three kinds of webhooks which allow its users perform custom actions at different stages of a workflow's lifecycle:

- Whenever a workflow build is **created**.
- Whenever a workflow build **starts**.
- Whenever a workflow build **finishes**.

In this article, I will go through how you can use Xcode Cloud webhooks to send workflow run metrics to a third-party service.

## The webhook's payload

The data for each webhook is similar and is always sent as the body of a POST request in JSON format. The payload contains abundant information about the workflow, the specific run that triggered it and even the product that it was triggered for!

> You can find an example JSON with all the available data in [Xcode Cloud's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-webhooks-in-xcode-cloud).

From the information above, we're only interested in a few fields, which can be condensed into the following `JSON` object:

```json:payload.json
{
  "ciBuildRun": {
    "attributes": {
      "completionStatus": "SUCCEEDED",
      "startedDate": "2023-03-27T18:07:37.233Z",
      "executionProgress": "COMPLETE",
      "finishedDate": "2023-03-27T18:14:10.194Z",
      "sourceCommit": {
        "author": {
          "displayName": "Pol Piella Abadia"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "ciWorkflow": {
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Build and Test"
    }
  },
  "scmGitReference": {
    "attributes": {
      "name": "main",
      "kind": "BRANCH"
    }
  },
  "scmRepository": {
    "attributes": {
      "repositoryName": "QRBuddy"
    }
  }
}
```

## Receiving data from Xcode Cloud

In the server's code, the first thing we need to do is turn the payload above into a `Codable` struct:

```swift:Webhook.swift
struct WebhookPayload: Decodable {
  let ciBuildRun: CIBuildRun
  let ciWorkflow: CIWorkflow
  let scmGitReference: SCMGitReference
  let scmRepository: SCMRepository

  struct CIBuildRun: Decodable {
    let attributes: Attributes

    struct Attributes: Decodable {
      let completionStatus: String
      let startedDate: Date
      let executionProgress: String
      let finishedDate: Date
      let sourceCommit: SourceCommit

      struct SourceCommit: Decodable {
        let author: Author

        struct Author: Decodable {
          let displayName: String
        }
      }
    }
  }

  struct CIWorkflow: Decodable {
    let attributes: Attributes

    struct Attributes: Decodable {
      let name: String
    }
  }

  struct SCMGitReference: Decodable {
    let attributes: Attributes

    struct Attributes: Decodable {
      let name: String
      let kind: String
    }
  }

  struct SCMRepository: Decodable {
    let attributes: Attributes

    struct Attributes: Decodable {
      let repositoryName: String
    }
  }
}
```

As there is no way to subscribe to specific events in webhooks, data might vary based on the event that triggered the webhook. For example, the `finishedDate` field in the `ciBuildRun` object is only present in the webhook triggered when a workflow run finishes.

We can then use the `JSONDecoder` to turn the webhook's payload, which is in `Data` format, into the new `WebhookPayload` struct:

```swift:Webhook.swift
@main
struct XcodeCloudWebhookLambda: SimpleLambdaHandler {
    let decoder: JSONDecoder

    init() {
        let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
        dateFormatter.dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ"

        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        decoder.dateDecodingStrategy = .formatted(dateFormatter)
        self.decoder = decoder
    }

    func handle(_ request: APIGatewayV2Request, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> APIGatewayV2Response {
        guard let body = request.body,
              let bodyData = body.data(using: .utf8),
              let request = try? decoder.decode(WebhookPayload.self, from: bodyData) else {
            return .init(statusCode: .badRequest, body: "Could not parse the request content...")
        }
    }
}
```

> I have chosen to use an AWS lamdba for this example so that I could write my back-end service in Swift, but you can use any server that can receive POST requests. If you're interested in learning more about how to handle webhooks using Swift and AWS lambdas, please refer to my article on [GitHub webhooks and Xcode Cloud](https://www.polpiella.dev/github-webhooks-and-xcode-cloud).

## Only listening to webhooks when the workflow finishes

As we are only interested in logging workflow metrics when the finish, we can filter out the webhooks that are triggered when a workflow run is created or when it starts.

While the optional `try` operator in the previous section's decoding code would have allowed us to ignore any payload missing fields we are interested in, it would also be good to have some extra validation in place and make the event filtering more explicit.

We can do this by checking the `executionProgress` field in the `ciBuildRun` object. This field should be `COMPLETE` when the workflow run finishes:

```swift:Webhook.swift
@main
struct XcodeCloudWebhookLambda: SimpleLambdaHandler {
    let decoder: JSONDecoder

    init() {
        self.decoder = JSONDecoder()
    }

    func handle(_ request: APIGatewayV2Request, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> APIGatewayV2Response {
        guard let body = request.body,
              let bodyData = body.data(using: .utf8),
              let payload = try? snakeCaseDecoder.decode(WebhookPayload.self, from: bodyData),
              request.ciBuildRun.attributes.completionStatus == "COMPLETE" else {
            return .init(statusCode: .badRequest, body: "Could not parse the request content...")
        }
    }
}
```

## Sending the data to a third-party service

Now that we have a server that can receive data from Xcode Cloud, we need to adapt it into a format that can be sent to a third-party service.

I am not going to go into detail about this analytics system, but all you need to know is that it expects a POST request with the following payload and it aggregates data from multiple repositories and providers in a single database:

```json:payload.json
{
  "workflow": "unit-tests",
  "duration": 10.5,
  "date": "2023-03-27T18:14:10.194Z",
  "provider": "Xcode Cloud",
  "outcome": "success",
  "repository": "QRBuddy",
  "branch": "main",
  "author": "Pol Piella Abadia"
}
```

### Calculating the duration

The first thing we need to do is calculate the duration. The hard work for this calculation is done by setting the `dateDecodingStrategy` to a custom format which matches the one used by Xcode Cloud in the `JSONDecoder`'s initializer. All that's left for us to do now is to get the time interval between the `startedDate` and `finishedDate` fields:

```swift:Webhook.swift
func handle(_ request: APIGatewayV2Request, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> APIGatewayV2Response {
    // ...

    let duration = payload
        .ciBuildRun
        .attributes
        .finishedDate
        .timeIntervalSince(payload.ciBuildRun.attributes.startedDate)
}
```

The code above will return the duration in seconds, which is what we need to send to the analytics service.

### Mapping the outcome

The next thing we need to do is map Xcode Cloud's `completionStatus` field to what the analytics service expects. Our analytics service expects the outcome to be one of the following: `success`, `failure` or `cancelled`.

On the other hand, [Xcode Cloud's CiCompletionStatus docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/cicompletionstatus?changes=latest_major&language=_5) state that the outcome of a workflow run can be: `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `ERRORED`, `CANCELED` and `SKIPPED`.

We can start by modifying our `Decodable` model we defined earlier in the article to use an enum for the `completionStatus` field:

```swift:Webhook.swift
enum CompletionStatus: String, Decodable {
    case succeeded = "SUCCEEDED"
    case failed = "FAILED"
    case errored = "ERRORED"
    case canceled = "CANCELED"
    case skipped = "SKIPPED"
}

struct CIBuildRun: Decodable {
  let attributes: Attributes

  struct Attributes: Decodable {
    let completionStatus: String
    let startedDate: Date
    let executionProgress: String
    let finishedDate: Date
    let sourceCommit: SourceCommit

    struct SourceCommit: Decodable {
      let author: Author

      struct Author: Decodable {
        let displayName: String
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We can then write a function which handles the mapping across both domains:

```swift:Webhook.swift
// Analytics service domain
enum Outcome: String {
    case success
    case failure
    case cancelled
}

func handle(_ request: APIGatewayV2Request, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> APIGatewayV2Response {
    // ...
    let outcome = Self.adapt(xcodeCloudOutcome: payload.ciBuildRun.attributes.completionStatus)
}

private static func adapt(xcodeCloudOutcome: CompletionStatus) -> Outcome? {
    switch xcodeCloudOutcome {
    case .succeeded: return .success
    case .failed, .errored: return .failure
    case .canceled: return .cancelled
    // Not logging skipped runs
    case .skipped: return nil
    }
}
```

### Putting the pieces together

We now have all the pieces we need to put together a request to the analytics service:

```swift:Webhook.swift
func handle(_ request: APIGatewayV2Request, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> APIGatewayV2Response {
    // ...
    let payload = AnalyticsPayload(
        workflow: payload.ciWorkflow.attributes.name,
        duration: duration,
        date: payload.ciBuildRun.attributes.startedDate,
        provider: "Xcode Cloud",
        outcome: outcome,
        repository: payload.scmRepository.attributes.repositoryName,
        branch: payload.scmGitReference.attributes.name,
        author: payload.ciBuildRun.attributes.sourceCommit.author.displayName
    )

    // An example of a service that makes a POST request to an API
    analyticsService.send(payload: payload)
```

## Registering the webhook

Once we have our server ready to receive data from Xcode Cloud, we have to tell Xcode Cloud to send messages to the URL where we have deployed it.

The only way to do this currently is by going to the app you want to add the webhook to in App Store Connect, navigating to the Xcode Cloud section and clicking on the 'Settings' button. In the 'Settings' page, select the 'Webhooks' tap and click on the '+' button to add a webhook:

![Xcode Cloud settings page](/assets/posts/xcode-cloud-webhooks/xcode-cloud-settings.webp)

Doing this will open a modal where you can give your webhook a name and provide the URL where you have deployed your server:

![Xcode Cloud webhook modal](/assets/posts/xcode-cloud-webhooks/xcode-cloud-modal.webp)
