We recently fixed a bug in our app [Helm](https://helm-app.com/) which occurred when trying to set the time of a scheduled release using the App Store Connect API. 

The date we were sending in the request contained the **day, month, year, hour and minute**, but the API would only allow us to be **precise up to the hour**.

To fix the issue as quickly as possible and as SwiftUI's DatePicker can not be configured to only allow the user **to select the hour of the day without specifying the minute**, we decided to remove the extra information from the date before sending it to the API with a small extension on `Date`:

```swift:Date+KeepingInformation.swift
extension Date {
    func keepingInformation(
        dateComponents: Set<Calendar.Component> = [.year, .month, .day, .hour],
        in calendar: Calendar = .current
    ) -> Date {
        let dateComponents = calendar.dateComponents(dateComponents, from: self)
        
        return calendar.date(from: dateComponents) ?? self
    }
}
```

The code above extracts the desired date components from the `Date` instance and then uses the provided `Calendar` to create a new `Date` just with those components.
