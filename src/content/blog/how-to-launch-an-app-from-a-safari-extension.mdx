This week I have added a new feature to one of my side projects: QReate. This new feature allows you to create a new QR code in the app directly from the current tab's URL in Safari through an extension:

<Video src="/assets/posts/how-to-launch-an-app-from-a-safari-extension/demo.mp4" />

In this article, I will explain how the extension retrieves the current tab's URL and how it launches the app with the URL as a parameter.

## Creating a Safari extension

You can create a Safari extension for an existing macOS app in Xcode by going to File > New > Target and selecting 'Safari Extension' from the list of templates:

![Xcode template for a Safari extension](/assets/posts/how-to-launch-an-app-from-a-safari-extension/extension-template.webp)

### Setting things up

The template creates a new target in your project with most of the code we need but there are a few things we need to change and remove to make it work for our use case:

- In this case, the extension does not show any UI to the user when clicked. For this reason, we can remove the default `ViewController` and storyboard file the template creates for us.

- Additionally, we are not going to execute any Javascript code so we can also remove the `script.js` file from the Resources folder. We still need to keep the 'ToolbarItemIcon' file around (and replace it with a custom icon) as it is used to display the extension's icon in the toolbar.

- We need to give the extension a meaningful description to be displayed in the Safari preferences. This can be done by editing the 'NSHumanReadableDescription' field under 'NSExtension' in the target's `Info.plist` file.

- The extension needs to be able to access the current tab's URL and it hence requires a special set of permissions. We need to change the 'Level' field under 'SFSafariWebsiteAccess' to `All` so that we can read information about the current tab.

### A note on debugging

You can debug the extension by either launching the app target or the extension target and selecting Safari as the host application.

You must know that in both cases you will need to 'Allow Unsigned Extensions' in Safari's Develop menu.

Once you have done this, you can enable the extension in Safari's preferences and start testing your code:

### Launching the app

We can listen for the user clicking on the extension's icon by overriding the `toolbarItemClicked(in:)` method in the `SafariExtensionHandler` class:

```swift:SafariExtensionHandler.swift
import SafariServices

class SafariExtensionHandler: SFSafariExtensionHandler {
    override func toolbarItemClicked(in window: SFSafariWindow) {
        window.getActiveTab { (tab) in
            tab?.getActivePage(completionHandler: { (page) in
                page?.getPropertiesWithCompletionHandler( { (properties) in
                    if let url = properties?.url {
                        NSWorkspace.shared.open(URL(string: "qreate:new?content=\(url.absoluteString)")!)
                    }
                })
            })
        }
    }
}
```

In the method above, the extension retrieves the current tab in the Safari window, then the current page in the tab and finally the URL of said page.

Once the URL is retrieved, the extension launches the app by opening a URL with a custom scheme and feeding it the URL as a query parameter.

### Turning extension off when no URL is available

The extension should only be enabled when the user is on a page with a valid URL. We can turn off the extension by overriding the `validateToolbarItem(in:validationHandler:)` method in the `SafariExtensionHandler` class and only returning `true` when the current page has a valid URL:

```swift:SafariExtensionHandler.swift
import SafariServices

class SafariExtensionHandler: SFSafariExtensionHandler {
     override func validateToolbarItem(in window: SFSafariWindow, validationHandler: @escaping ((Bool, String) -> Void)) {
         window.getActiveTab { (tab) in
             tab?.getActivePage(completionHandler: { (page) in
                 page?.getPropertiesWithCompletionHandler( { (properties) in
                     validationHandler(properties?.url != nil, "")
                 })
             })
         }
     }
}
```

## Handling the deep link in the app

Now that the extension can launch the app through a deep link with the current tab's URL as a query parameter, we need to add some code to handle this deep link in the app with two simple steps:

1. **Registering** a URL type.
2. **Listening** for deep links.

### Adding a URL type

The first step to handling a deep link in the app is to add a URL type with the same scheme launched from the Safari extension to the app's target in Xcode.

This can be done by going to the 'Info' tab of the target's setting and adding a new entry in the 'URL Types' section:

![Registering a URL type for a target in Xcode](/assets/posts/how-to-launch-an-app-from-a-safari-extension/url-type.webp)

### Listening for deep links

If you're using SwiftUI, handling a deep link is as simple as adding a `.onOpenURL` modifier to the View that should listen for events:

```swift:QRCodeList.swift
List(viewModel.qrCodes, id: \.id, selection: Binding<UUID?>(get: { viewModel.selectedQRCode }, set: viewModel.listItemTapped(_:))) { qrCode in
    // ...
}
.onOpenURL { url in
    let components = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: false)
    if let content = components?.queryItems?.first(where: { $0.name == "content" })?.value,
        let url = URL(string: content) {
        viewModel.handleDeepLink(url)
    }
}
```

The `onOpenURL` view modifier can then retrieve the URL components from the deep link, find the content query parameter and then create a new QR code with the URL in the content parameter.
