While there is a lot you can display in the terminal, there is certain information that is better conveyed in a graphical user interface. Contrary to what you might think, you **don't need to create a full-blown macOS app** to display a simple UI.

In this article, I will show you how you can launch a SwiftUI view directly from your Swift command-line tool without changing the application's call site.

## The command-line tool

Let's create a small command-line tool that allows users to **enter a hex value** and then shows a view with the corresponding colour to help them visualize it:

![A window showing the colour entered by the user](/assets/posts/launching-a-swiftui-view-from-the-terminal/output.webp)

## Creating the project

First, create a new executable Swift Package:

```bash:Terminal
mkdir color-visualizer && cd color-visualizer
swift package init --type executable --name ColorVisualizer
```

This will create a package manifest with a **single executable target** containing only one file called `main.swift`.

## Passing the colour hex as an argument

As I mentioned earlier in the article, we want the user to be able to pass a hex value to the command-line tool that we can then use to display the colour in a SwiftUI view.

There are multiple ways you can read arguments from the command line, but my favourite one and the one we'll be using in this article is [ArgumentParser, an open-source Swift Package by Apple](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser).

### Adding ArgumentParser

To start using [ArgumentParser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser), you first need to add it as a dependency to both the package and the executable target in the manifest:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.9

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "ColorVisualizer",
    products: [
        .executable(name: "ColorVisualizer", targets: ["ColorVisualizer"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser.git", exact: "1.2.3")
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "ColorVisualizer",
            dependencies: [.product(name: "ArgumentParser", package: "swift-argument-parser")]
        ),
    ]
)
```

### Reading the argument

Now that we have added [ArgumentParser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) as a dependency, we can create our `AsyncParsableCommand` with an argument of type String called `hex`.

```swift:ColorVisualizer.swift
import ArgumentParser

@main
struct ColorVisualizer: AsyncParsableCommand {
    @Argument(help: "The hex value of the colour you want to visualize.")
    var hex: String

    func run() async throws {
        // Using a small `Color` extension from `@MarcoEidinger`
        // https://blog.eidinger.info/from-hex-to-color-and-back-in-swiftui
        guard let color = Color(hex: hex) else {
            print("ðŸ˜¢ \(hex) is not a valid hex colour")
            return
        }

        print("ðŸŽ¨ Hex colour: \(color.toHex()!)")
    }
}
```

> Note that if you use `ArgumentParser`, you will need to add the `@main` attribute to the command struct you want to use as the entry point for your executable. You need to know that, once you do this, you won't be able to name any file in the executable target `main.swift` or write any top-level code, otherwise, you will get a compiler error.

## Launching a SwiftUI view

Now that we have the hex value in our application, we need to find a way of launching a SwiftUI view that displays it.

We will do this by using AppKit's `NSApplication` class, creating a new instance of `NSWindow` and setting its `contentViewController` to an `NSHostingView` instance that wraps our SwiftUI view.

### Creating a SwiftUI view

The SwiftUI view we will be using is fairly simple and consists of a rounded rectangle filled with the input colour and a label showing the hex value as a string:

```swift:ColorDisplay.swift
import SwiftUI

struct ColorDisplay: View {
    let color: Color

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Rectangle()
                .fill(color.opacity(0.4).gradient)
            VStack(spacing: 20) {
                RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20)
                    .fill(color)
                    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
                    .shadow(color: .black.opacity(0.15), radius: 10)

                if let hexString = color.toHex() {
                    Text("#\(hexString)")
                        .font(.largeTitle)
                        .fontWeight(.heavy)
                        .fontDesign(.rounded)
                }
            }

        }
        .frame(width: 600, height: 600)
    }
}
```

### Creating an NSWindow

Now that we have a SwiftUI view, we can subclass `NSApplicationDelegate` and write some code that creates a new `NSWindow` instance and sets its `contentView` to an `NSHostingView` that wraps your SwiftUI view as soon as the app launches.

```swift:AppDelegate.swift
import AppKit
import SwiftUI

final class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
    var window: NSWindow!
    let color: Color

    init(color: Color) {
        self.color = color
    }

    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        let window = NSWindow(
            contentRect: .zero,
            styleMask: [.closable, .resizable, .titled],
            backing: .buffered,
            defer: false
        )
        window.contentViewController = NSHostingController(
            rootView: ColorDisplay(color: color)
        )
        window.makeKey()
        window.center()
        window.orderFrontRegardless()
        if let colorString = color.toHex() {
            window.title = "ðŸŽ¨ Hex - \(colorString)"
        }
        self.window = window
    }
}
```

### Launching the `NSApplication`

Now that we have a delegate that will create a window for us, we need to activate and run an `NSApplication` and set its delegate accordingly:

```swift:App.swift
import AppKit

@MainActor
class App {
    let color: Color
    let delegate: AppDelegate

    init(color: Color) {
        self.color = color
        self.delegate = AppDelegate(color: color)
    }

    func run() {
        let app = NSApplication.shared
        app.delegate = delegate
        app.setActivationPolicy(.regular)
        app.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)
        app.run()
    }
}
```

### Running the app

Let's now put the pieces together and run the app from our `AsyncParsableCommand`:

```swift:ColorVisualizer.swift
import ArgumentParser

@main
struct ColorVisualizer: AsyncParsableCommand {
    @Argument(help: "The hex value of the colour you want to visualize.")
    var hex: String

    func run() async throws {
        guard let color = Color(hex: hex) else {
            print("ðŸ˜¢ \(hex) is not a valid hex colour")
            return
        }

        await App(color: color).run()
    }
}
```

### Result ðŸŽ¨

That's it! We have now created a command-line tool that launches a SwiftUI view with very little code.

When you run the app and pass it a hex code as an argument, you should see something like this:
