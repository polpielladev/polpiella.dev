This week I came across a situation where I had to pass the member of an optional struct held as a `@State` property to a child view as a `Binding`. 

Sounds simple, right? Well, the problem was that the child view, which I did not have control over, was expecting a `Binding` with a non-optional value:

```swift:ContenView.swift
import SwiftUI

struct Version: Identifiable {
    let id: String
    var name: String
}

@Observable
final class ViewModel {
    var version: Version?
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var viewModel = ViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Version Name", text: $viewModel.version?.name)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

When I tried to compile the code above, I got an error saying that **I could not use optional chaining to access the  non-optional `viewModel.version`**:

## Unwrapping optional values in a SwiftUI Binding

This made sense, as while the property `version` is optional, the `Binding` we are accessing through the `$` prefix is not. It is a non-optional `Binding` with a wrapped value of type `String?`.

At this point I had two options: either change the `version` property to be non-optional by providing default values for all of its properties or find a way to safely unwrap the optional value inside the `Binding`. 

I decided to go with the latter as it would **scale better** and **keeping the optionality made sense** in the context of the application to reflect the user's selection.

I did a bit of research and, thanks to [this amazing Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58297743), I was pointed to an initializer of `Binding` I was not aware of: [`init?(_ base: Binding<Value?>)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/init(_:)-5z9t9). In a nutshell, what this initializer does is **unwrap the optional value** the `Binding` is holding and instead provide an optional `Binding` with a **non-optional value**.

Let's now modify the code above to use this initializer:

```swift:ContentView.swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var viewModel = ViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if let unwrapped = Binding($viewModel.version) {
                TextField("Version Name", text: unwrapped.name)
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

Make sure you safely unwrap the optional binding as shown above, as if its wrapped value becomes `nil` during the view's lifecycle, the `Binding` will also become `nil`.
