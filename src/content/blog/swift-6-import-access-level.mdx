The [SE-0409](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0409-access-level-on-imports.md) proposal introduced the ability to mark import declarations with an access level to limit the types or interfaces that imported symbols can be used in. Thanks to these changes, dependencies can now be marked as being visible to the current source file (`private` or `fileprivate`), module (`internal`), package (`package`), or all clients (`public`).

Up until this proposal, which is implemented behind a feature flag and won't be enabled until Swift 6, all import declarations were implicitly `public`. The new proposal makes dependency imports `internal` by default and requires developers to explicitly mark import statements with the desired access level to override this behavior. 

This is a great addition to the language that I have personally longed for as it allows developers to better hide implementation details and enforce separation of concerns. Not only that but it also limits the amount of dependencies imported by a package's clients to the ones marked as `public`, leading to shorter compile times.
