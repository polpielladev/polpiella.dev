Let's consider your app is using a custom font and you have a `Font` enum which lazily loads the font resources and vends them to the rest of your app:

```swift:Font.swift
public enum Font {
    public static let regular = FontFamily.MyAwesomeFont.regular
    public static let medium = FontFamily.MyAwesomeFont.medium
    public static let bold = FontFamily.MyAwesomeFont.bold
}
```

The rest of your app then uses this enum in a View modifier to apply the font to SwiftUI views:

```

```

This code works well but let's now say you are starting a new app from scratch that uses the same code but has different text styles.

You can move the `Font` enum into its own Swift Package and share it across both apps and leave the responsibility of defining the text styles to each of the clients consuming the new library.
