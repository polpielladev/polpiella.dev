Markdown is a file format that is used to write formatted text. It is very commonly used in the software development world to write documentation, README files, and even blog posts.

There are some times when you need to parse markdown files into a format you can use in your application to perform actions such as deleting or replacing elements.

In this article, I will show you how to parse and modify markdown content using [swift-markdown](), an open-source library provided by Apple.

## Setting up swift-markdown

[swift-markdonw]() is distributed as a Swift package, so depending on the needs of your library or app, you can add it one of two ways:

### Xcode projects

Add [swift-markdown]() to your Xcode project by opening the `Package Dependencies` tab for the project and clicking the `+` button and enter the URL for the [swift-markdown]() repository:

![]()

Next, select the version of [swift-markdown]() you want to use and click `Add Package`:

![]()

Finally, add the Markdown product to the target you want to use it in:

![]()
