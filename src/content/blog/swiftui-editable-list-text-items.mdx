Lists with editable text inputs are a common UI pattern in macOS apps. Apple uses this pattern in apps such as the macOS finder or SF Symbols. I used this pattern in an app I have been working on. The user can create QR codes which are stored in a Core Data layer, customise them, and save them with a custom name.

The app persists all QR codes in a list and the user can rename them by clicking on their title. This article shows how to build editable text items in a macOS SwiftUI list.

> Full credit to [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67864507/17421764) for giving me the idea and inspiration for making my own version of an editable text view which works well with SwiftUI lists.

## Creating a selectable list

To create the component you first need to create a list with a set of text items on it. You can also make the list selectable by adding a `selection` binding which holds and update the value of the selected item's id.

```swift:ContentView.swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel = ViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        List(viewModel.items, id: \.id, selection: $viewModel.selectedId) { item in
            Text(item)
        }
    }
}
```

## Making an editable text component

You can now make the list items editable by creating a custom `EditableListItem` which renders both a `Text` and a `TextField` views and hides and shows them based on user interaction.

```swift:EditableListItem.swift
struct EditableListItem: View {
    @Binding var text: String
    let isSelected: Bool

    @State private var temporaryText: String
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool

    init(text: Binding<String>, isSelected: Bool) {
        self.isSelected = isSelected
        self._text = text
        self.temporaryText = text.wrappedValue
    }

    var body: some View {
        ZStack(alignment: .leading) {
            if isSelected {
                Text(temporaryText)
                    .padding(.leading, 8)
                    .onTapGesture { isFocused = true }
                    .opacity(isFocused ? 0 : 1)
            } else {
                Text(temporaryText)
                    .padding(.leading, 8)
                    .opacity(isFocused ? 0 : 1)
            }

            TextField("", text: $temporaryText, onCommit: { text = temporaryText })
                .focused($isFocused, equals: true)
                .opacity(isFocused ? 1 : 0)
        }
        .contextMenu {
            Button(action: { isFocused = true }, label: { Text("Rename") })
        }
    }
}
```

> The `TextField` view seems to have 8 pixels of leading padding by default. To make the `Text` and `TextField` views line up, I had to add 8 pixels of leading padding to the `Text` view.

You can now replace the `Text` view in the list with the new `EditableListItem` view:

```swift:ContentView.swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel = ViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        List(viewModel.items, id: \.id, selection: $viewModel.selectedId) { item in
            EditableListItem(
                text: .init(get: { item.name }, set: { viewModel.renamed(id: item.id, name: $0) }), isSelected: item.id == viewModel.selectedId
            )
        }
    }
}
```
