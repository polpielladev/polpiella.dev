Apple uses texts with editable text items in a number of apps such as the macOS finder or SF Symbols. These views are so widely used across the ecosystem that being able to edit text items on a list has become somewhat of an expected behaviour for most apps.

Despite this pattern being so widely used, there is no out-of-the-box solution in the standard SwiftUI library to create views like this. This article goes through how you can create a custom view built on top of the standard `TextField` component to unlock this behaviour:

<Video src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dflewmkx4/video/upload/ac_none,f_auto,q_auto:eco/blog/posts/swiftui-macos-editable-text-views/demo.mp4" />

As shown in the preceding video, the component behaves in the following way:

1. The view is **not editable by default**.
2. When the user **clicks on the view**, it becomes editable and focused.
3. When the user **presses the escape key**, the view reverts to its initial value and loses focus.
4. When the user **presses the return key**, the binding passed in by the parent view gets updated.

> I want to give credit to [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67864507/17421764) for giving me the idea and inspiration for making an editable text view in SwiftUI.

## The editable text component

The `EditableText` view wraps a standard SwiftUI `TextField` to provide extra capabilities while keeping the call site as close as possible.

### TL;DR

If you want to skip the explanation and just see the code, you can find the full source code for the `EditableText` view here:

```swift:EditableText.swift
struct EditableText: View {
    @Binding var text: String

    @State private var temporaryText: String
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool

    init(text: Binding<String>) {
        self._text = text
        self.temporaryText = text.wrappedValue
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("", text: $temporaryText, onCommit: { text = temporaryText })
            .focused($isFocused, equals: true)
            .onTapGesture { isFocused = true }
            .onExitCommand { temporaryText = text; isFocused = false }
            .contextMenu {
                Button(action: { isFocused = true }, label: { Text("Rename") })
            }
    }
}
```

### Keeping an internal state

The component takes in a text binding and immediately creates a `temporaryText` internal state variable initialised with the binding's current value.

This internal state is necessary to keep hold of the user's edits to the initial text and not update the binding's value until the text's `onCommit` closure gets called.

This closure is not called until the user has finished editing by either **pressing the return key** or **tapping outside of the view**.

```swift:EditableText.swift
struct EditableText: View {
    @Binding var text: String

    @State private var temporaryText: String

    init(text: Binding<String>) {
        self._text = text
        self.temporaryText = text.wrappedValue
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("", text: $temporaryText, onCommit: { text = temporaryText })
    }
}
```

### Making the text editable

At the moment, the view you created in the previous section is always editable and focused.

You want to change its behaviour so that it becomes focused and editable whenever the user **clicks on it**. Furthermore, the component should be in a **non-editable state by default**.

You can achieve this by creating a `@FocusState` property and then passing it as a binding to the `TextField`'s `focused` view modifier.

You can then use the `onTapGesture` view modifier to set the `isFocused` property to true when a user clicks on the view, which in turn sets the focus on the `TextField`.

```swift:EditableText.swift
struct EditableText: View {
    @Binding var text: String

    @State private var temporaryText: String
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool

    init(text: Binding<String>) {
        self._text = text
        self.temporaryText = text.wrappedValue
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("", text: $temporaryText, onCommit: { text = temporaryText })
            .focused($isFocused, equals: true)
            .onTapGesture { isFocused = true }
    }
}
```

## Roll changes back when the user presses the escape key

The great thing about keeping an internal state and not automatically updating the text binding on every change is that you can roll back the changes when the user presses the escape key and cancels the editing action.

To achieve this, add an `onExitCommand` view modifier to the `TextField` and pass it a closure which changes the value of `temporaryText` to the text binding's current value.

```swift:EditableText.swift
struct EditableText: View {
    @Binding var text: String

    @State private var temporaryText: String
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool

    init(text: Binding<String>) {
        self._text = text
        self.temporaryText = text.wrappedValue
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("", text: $temporaryText, onCommit: { text = temporaryText })
            .focused($isFocused, equals: true)
            .onTapGesture { isFocused = true }
            .onExitCommand { temporaryText = text; isFocused = false }
    }
}
```

## Improving the editable capability's discoverability

If you rely on this UI pattern as the sole means of editing a text item in your app, you can **make it easier for users to find out about this feature** by adding a **context menu** action to the view which provides an alternative way of making the view editable.

The menu has a single action called 'Rename' which, when clicked on, focuses the `TextField` and makes it editable.

```swift:EditableText.swift
struct EditableText: View {
    @Binding var text: String

    @State private var temporaryText: String
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool

    init(text: Binding<String>) {
        self._text = text
        self.temporaryText = text.wrappedValue
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("", text: $temporaryText, onCommit: { text = temporaryText })
            .focused($isFocused, equals: true)
            .onTapGesture { isFocused = true }
            .onExitCommand { temporaryText = text; isFocused = false }
            .contextMenu {
                Button(action: { isFocused = true }, label: { Text("Rename") })
            }
    }
}
```
