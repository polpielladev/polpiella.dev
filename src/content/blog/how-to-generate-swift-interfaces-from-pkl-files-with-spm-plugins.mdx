Pkl (pronounced Pickle) is a new programming language from Apple designed specifically for configuration.

As it couldn't be any other way with Pkl being an Apple language, it has a suite of tools available for generating Swift interfaces from Pkl configuration files. 

In this article, you will learn how to install and use the `pkl-gen-swift` command-line tool and how to integrate it into your Swift Package Manager (SPM) project as a plugin.
