Pkl (pronounced Pickle) is a new programming language from Apple designed specifically for configuration. It allows developers to design data models richly and expressively through the use of types and then validate them to catch errors early on.

A feature that sets it apart for Apple developers and, as it couldn't be any other way with Pkl being an Apple language, is that it has a suite of tools available for generating Swift interfaces from `.pkl` configuration files. 

In this article, you will learn how to install and use the `pkl-gen-swift` command-line tool and how to integrate it into your Swift Package Manager (SPM) project as a plugin.
