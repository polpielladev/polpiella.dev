Pkl (pronounced Pickle) is a new programming language from Apple designed specifically for configuration. It allows developers to design data models richly and expressively through the use of types and then validate them to catch errors early on.

A feature that sets it apart for Apple developers and, as it couldn't be any other way with Pkl being an Apple language, is that it has a suite of tools available for generating Swift interfaces from `.pkl` configuration files. 

In this article, you will learn how to install and use the `pkl-gen-swift` command-line tool and how to integrate it into your Swift Package Manager (SPM) project as a plugin.

Something you must note is that, at this point, Pkl is only available for macOS.

## An example Pkl config

Let's get started by creating a simple Pkl module called `Config` with a set of properties that will define the configuration of a small macOS Swift Package library:

```pkl:Config.pkl
module Config

baseUrl: String
retryCount: Int(isBetween(0, 3))
timeout: Duration
```

As you can see in the snippet above, we are making use of types and ranges to constraint the values that can be assigned to the properties and reduce the likelihood of errors. These types will be used by the Pkl CLI tools to both validate the configuration files and help generate Swift interfaces.

Let's now write a separate `.pkl` file that amends this module file and provides values for the development configuration:

```pkl:local.pkl
amends "Config.pkl"

baseUrl = "https://localhost:8080"
retryCount = 0
timeout = 30.s
```

And just like that, we have written a small configuration and we have specified some types and constraints that we can enforce.

Let's now install the `pkl` command line tool and evaluate the module that defines the actual values:

```bash:Terminal
# Install pkl
curl -L -o pkl https://github.com/apple/pkl/releases/download/0.25.2/pkl-macos-aarch64
chmod +x pkl

# Evaluate the local file
./pkl eval Sources/ClientExample/Resources/local.pkl
```

The output of running the commands above prints the correct values and validates that the configurations can be validated accordingly:

```bash:Terminal
baseUrl = "https://localhost:8080"
retryCount = 0
timeout = 30.s
```

## Generating Swift bindings

As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, one of the most powerful features of defining your configuration using Pkl is that you can generate Swift interfaces for your apps.

To generate Swift interfaces from `pkl` files, you need to install the `pkl` and `pkl-gen-swift` command-line tools. I will now show you how you can install and use them both manually and in a Swift Package Manager plugin.

### Installing and using `pkl-gen-swift` manually

First, let's install the `pkl-gen-swift` command-line tool:

```bash:Terminal
curl -L https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/releases/download/0.2.3/pkl-gen-swift-macos.bin -o pkl-gen-swift
chmod +x pkl-gen-swift
```

Let's now generate Swift interfaces from the `.pkl` files by running the following command with all input files as arguments and the output directory passed to the `-o` flag:

```bash:Terminal
PKL_EXEC=./pkl
./pkl-gen-swift Sources/ClientExample/Resources/*.pkl -o Sources/ClientExample/Generated
```

Note that `pkl-gen-swift` relies on the `pkl` command-line tool, which needs to either be found in your `PATH` or be specified using the `PKL_EXEC` environment variable.

The output of the command will be a single Swift file that contains the generated interface:

```swift:Sources/ClientExample/Generated/Config.pkl.swift
// Code generated from Pkl module `Config`. DO NOT EDIT.
import PklSwift

public enum Config {}

extension Config {
    public struct Module: PklRegisteredType, Decodable, Hashable {
        public static var registeredIdentifier: String = "Config"

        public var baseUrl: String

        public var retryCount: Int

        public var timeout: Duration

        public init(baseUrl: String, retryCount: Int, timeout: Duration) {
            self.baseUrl = baseUrl
            self.retryCount = retryCount
            self.timeout = timeout
        }
    }

    /// Load the Pkl module at the given source and evaluate it into `Config.Module`.
    ///
    /// - Parameter source: The source of the Pkl module.
    public static func loadFrom(source: ModuleSource) async throws -> Config.Module {
        try await PklSwift.withEvaluator { evaluator in
            try await loadFrom(evaluator: evaluator, source: source)
        }
    }

    /// Load the Pkl module at the given source and evaluate it with the given evaluator into
    /// `Config.Module`.
    ///
    /// - Parameter evaluator: The evaluator to use for evaluation.
    /// - Parameter source: The module to evaluate.
    public static func loadFrom(
        evaluator: PklSwift.Evaluator,
        source: PklSwift.ModuleSource
    ) async throws -> Config.Module {
        try await evaluator.evaluateModule(source: source, as: Module.self)
    }
}
```

### Creating a SPM command plugin

Let's say you don't want everyone who consumes your Swift Package to have to install all required tools manually to be able to generate code when they modify the configurations.

You can instead create a Swift Package Manager command plugin that will wrap the command-line tools and expose a client-friendly command that finds all configuration files and generates Swift interfaces.

Let's consider the following Swift Package:

```swift:Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.9
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "PklSwiftPlugin",
    platforms: [
        // 1
        .macOS(.v13),
    ],
    products: [
        // 2
        .plugin(name: "PklSwiftCommand", targets: ["PklSwiftCommand"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        // 3
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift.git", exact: "0.2.3")
    ],
    targets: [
        // 4
        .plugin(name: "PklSwiftCommand",
                capability: .command(intent: .custom(verb: "swift-pkl", description: ""),
                                     permissions: [.writeToPackageDirectory(reason: "Write pkl to pkg")]),
                dependencies: [.product(name: "pkl-gen-swift", package: "pkl-swift"), "Pkl"]),
        // 5
        .binaryTarget(name: "Pkl",
                      path: "Pkl.artifactbundle"),
        // 6
        .target(name: "ClientExample",
                dependencies: [.product(name: "PklSwift", package: "pkl-swift")])
    ]
)
```

Let's break down what's going on above step by step:

1. We declare that the package is only available for macOS 13 and later to satisfy the requirement of [pkl-swift]().
2. We declare a new product of type `plugin` that will be used to expose the `swift-pkl` command.
3. We declare the dependencies of the package, which is Apple's [pkl-swift]() package, that provides the Swift binding for the Pkl language and the executable to generate the interfaces.
4. We declare a new target for the `swift-pkl` command plugin. We also declare the dependencies of the plugin, which are the `pkl-gen-swift` executable and the `Pkl` package in the form of an artifact bundle. Luckily enough, we can rely on the executable product from the [pkl-swift]() package to add the Swift generator as a dependency but we need to manually create an artifact bundle for the `pkl` command-line tool.
5. We declare a new binary target for the `pkl` command-line tool's artifact bundle.
6. We declare a new target for the Swift Package that will consume the plugin for testing. This is the target that will contain the `.pkl` files configuration files.

To create an artifact bundle, you just need to create a directory with the same name you have declared in the package manifest and with a `.artifactbundle` extension. In this directory, create the following folder structure:

Create a folder structure with a json file and a directory  at the root and then the directory has two more nested levels 
    
```
Pkl.artifactbundle
├── info.json
├── pkl-0.25.2-macos
│   └── bin
│       └── pkl
```

The `info.json` file should contain the following:

```json:info.json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "artifacts": {
    "pkl": {
      "version": "0.2.3",
      "type": "executable",
      "variants": [
        {
          "path": "pkl-0.25.2-macos/bin/pkl",
          "supportedTriples": ["arm64-apple-macosx"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Let's now write the code for the command plugin. The command will retrieve the command line tools from the context, iterates through the targets to find all `.pkl` files and then finally runs the `pkl-gen-swift` executable to generate the Swift interfaces:

```swift:Sources/PklSwiftCommand/main.swift
import PackagePlugin
import Foundation

@main
struct PklSwiftCommandPlugin: CommandPlugin {
    func performCommand(context: PluginContext, arguments: [String]) async throws {
        let pklGenSwift = try context.tool(named: "pkl-gen-swift")
        let pkl = try context.tool(named: "pkl")
        let pklGenSwiftURL = URL(filePath: pklGenSwift.path.string)
        
        for target in context.package.targets {
            let dirEnum = FileManager.default.enumerator(atPath: target.directory.string)
            var pklFiles = [Path]()
            while let file = dirEnum?.nextObject() as? String {
                if file.hasSuffix(".pkl") {
                    pklFiles.append(target.directory.appending(subpath: file))
                }
            }
            
            let process = Process()
            process.executableURL = pklGenSwiftURL
            process.arguments = pklFiles.map { $0.string } + ["-o", target.directory.appending(subpath: "Generated").string]
            process.environment = ["PKL_EXEC": pkl.path.string]
            
            try process.run()
            process.waitUntilExit()
            
            let gracefulExit = process.terminationReason == .exit && process.terminationStatus == 0
            if !gracefulExit {
                throw "🛑 The plugin execution failed with reason: \(process.terminationReason.rawValue) and status: \(process.terminationStatus) "
            }
        }
    }
}

extension String: Error {}
```

The command plugin can now be run like so:

```bash:Terminal
swift package --disable-sandbox swift-pkl --allow-writing-to-package-directory
```

Note that you will need to use the `--disable-sandbox` flag otherwise the plugin will hang indefinitely and not work. I have not been able to find another workaround at the moment but I am still investigating.
