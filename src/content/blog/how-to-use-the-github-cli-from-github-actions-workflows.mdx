As a maintainer of the [appstoreconnect-swift-sdk](https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk) library, I often find myself keeping an eye on [new releases of the App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app-store-connect-api-release-notes) and then manually updating the library's code based using the new version's OpenAPI spec.

As you can imagine, this process is not very scalable and relies heavily on manual input, which can lead to situations where the library misses updates of the API altogether.

For this reason, I decided to take action and automate this process using GitHub Actions and the GitHub CLI and, in this article, I will show you how a combination of the GitHub CLI and a GitHub Actions workflow can help you remove manual tasks that cause friction.

## Using GitHub CLI from Actions workflows

GitHub CLI is installed and ready-to-use out of the box on all GitHub-Hosted runners. To use it, can simply use the `gh` command from any of your workflows and pass an environment variable called `GH_TOKEN` to the step where you will be using the GitHub CLI:

```yml:github_cli.yml
name: Using GitHub CLI

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  use_github_cli:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: gh --help
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The `GH_TOKEN` environment variable is used by the GitHub CLI to authenticate with GitHub's API and, as GitHub Actions workflows contain an auto-generated API token scoped to the workflow's repository, we can just access it from the workflow's secrets and set it to the environment with the right variable name.

### GITHUB_TOKEN elevated permissions

It is important to note that, by default, the auto-generated `GITHUB_TOKEN` available in all GitHub Actions workflows' secrets is **read-only** and, if you want **to perform tasks that require a higher degree of permissions** in the repository such as pushing changes or creating a pull request, you need to give it an elevated set of permissions.

You can do this directly in the workflow file by using the `permissions` property. For example, in my example, where I had to push changes to a repository and then use the CLI to create a Pull Request, I had to set two elevated permissions:

```yml:synchronize_asc_api.yml
name: Synchronize ASC API

permissions:
    contents: write
    pull-requests: write
```

Once these elevated permissions have been set, you can push code to the repository and perfrom Pull Request operations:

```yml:synchronize_asc_api.yml
# ...

jobs:
  create_pr:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: |
          # ...
          git config --local user.name "App Store Connect Swift SDK CI"
          git switch --create spec-update-$NEW_VERSION
          git add --all
          git commit -m "[ci skip] Update spec to $NEW_VERSION"
          git push -u origin spec-update-$NEW_VERSION
          create_pr_output=$(gh pr create --title "Update OpenAPI spec to $NEW_VERSION" --body "$warnings")
          echo "Pull request created: $create_pr_output"
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Find the right automation for you!

The GitHub CLI [offers over 25 commands that perform multiple different GitHub tasks using the GitHub API](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh). Make sure you check out the documentation to explore the full list of commands and automations available and start streamlining your process!
