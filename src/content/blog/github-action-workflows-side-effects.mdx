One of the features that I like the most about GitHub Actions is the number of different events that you can use to trigger a workflow.

Triggers are defined using the [on rule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) in the workflow file and there is a wide range of options available such as pushes to all or specific branches or changes to a pull request.

I recently learnt, thanks to this tweet from [James Sherlock](https://twitter.com/JamesSherlouk), that you can also use GitHub webhook events to trigger workflow runs. I have since used one of GitHub's available webhook events to trigger a workflow based on the completion of another workflow.

The workflow [James](https://twitter.com/JamesSherlouk) refers to in his tweet is used in the [Swift Package Index project to generate PRs from issues using the `issues` event as a trigger.](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/PackageList/blob/main/.github/workflows/issues.yml)

## What is a webhook?

Webhooks are automated messages that a website sends to a URL based on the occurrence of specific events. For example, when a workflow finishes running, GitHub sends a `workflow_url` event to the URL configured to receive such events.

GitHub webhooks are configurable on a per-repository basis and provide a great way to build custom integrations and automations. If you want a more in-depth example of a practical use case which involves webhooks and Xcode Cloud check out [this article on my blog](https://www.polpiella.dev/github-webhooks-and-xcode-cloud).

## Triggering a workflow based on the `workflow_run` event

While webhooks can be very powerful, building integrations with them is not straightforward. They are POST network requests with a payload containing context and information about the action which triggered the event and hence require you to build, set up and maintain a back-end service that can receive POST network requests, parse their bodies and perform a set of actions when needed.

The great news is that GitHub Actions provide a way to define a webhook event as the trigger or start condition for a workflow directly from the definition file, which removes the need to build and maintain a back-end service ðŸŽ‰.

In my specific use case, I want to set up a workflow that runs after a specific workflow or set of workflows finish executing, which is as simple as:

1. Adding the `workflow_run` event to the `on` rule in the workflow file. This is the same you would do if you were using a different event such as `push` or `pull_request`.
2. Filtering the event based on the `workflow_run`'s activity types. Out of the three available types (`completed`, `requested` and `in_progress`), I am only interested in the `completed` activity type.
3. Specifying the workflow name to trigger on. This is **required** and in my case, I am only interested in triggering the log workflow when the Lint workflow completes.

```yaml:.github/workflows/log.yml
name: Log workflow run metrics
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [Lint]
    types:
      - completed
jobs:
  log:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    env:
      ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT: ${{ secrets.ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          repository: polpielladev/metrics
      - run: |
          swift run GithubActionsMetricsCLI \
            "${{ github.event.workflow_run.name }}" \
            "${{ github.event.workflow_run.updated_at }}" \
            "${{ github.event.workflow_run.run_started_at }}" \
            "${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_repository.name }}" \
            "${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion }}" \
            "${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_commit.author.name }}"

```

As part of its execution, the workflow above checks out an external repository and then runs a script to log metrics from the Lint's workflow run to a third-party service.

As you can see in the code above, the workflow can access the webhook payload data using the `github.event.workflow_run` context variable and pass the relevant information from the event to the metrics script.
