I have recently been trying to get my Swift package [Reading Time]() to run in different environemnts and packages in the form of a command line tool. While doing so, I have faced challenges of all kinds with compiling to these other operating systems and architectures and in this article I will explain how I used certain [compiler directives]() to fix them.

## What are compiler directives?

## APIs not available

## Preventing packages from being fetched

## What else can you do?
