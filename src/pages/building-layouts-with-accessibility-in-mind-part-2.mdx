In the [previous article](https://www.polpiella.dev/building-layouts-with-accessibility-in-mind-part-1) we made use of self-sizing `UIStackView`s to ensure that the layout we built respected all possible user's content size preferences and making all content and buttons accessible.

One thing we missed in part one was that, while the views on-screen would resize correctly based on the user's selected content size category, it sometimes caused the copy message and action button to go off screen in some devices.

In this second and last part, we'll address this issue by using a `UIScrollView` and ensuring that the content on screen is always accessible to the user, no matter how much space it takes or how small the device is.

## Setting up a UIScrollView

The use of `UIScrollView` is very common in mobile app development, since very often we won't be able to guarantee the size of the content or the device it will displayed on. While the range of devices is not as wide and varied as Android devices, we have quite a big range of screen sizes to deal with and it is our job to ensure that our apps look great and are usable across the whole range.

> For example, the iphone SE (2nd Generation)'s screen size is 320 px by 568 px while the 5th gen iPad Pro (12.9") is 1024 Ã— 1366 px, roughly about 3 times bigger than the SE.

Despite the fact that `UIScrollView`s are extremely powerful and they help us overcome these issues with relative ease, they are not the most intuitive to set up and there are a few things we need to keep in mind should we want to get the correct results.

### Adding content

You can think of `UIScrollView`s as plain `UIView`s with super powers. If the content you put in it fits within the **frame** of the `UIScrollView`, it will display it as a normal `UIView` would. However, if the content suddenly gets **too big to fit** in the `UIScrollView`'s frame, it will increase **its content size and it will become scrollable** to allow users to reach any overflowing content.

> If you have ever done any `css` in the past, this is similar to setting `overflow-x: scroll` or `overflow-y: scroll` in an element, with more setup code ðŸ˜….

To layout content inside a `UIScrollView`, we first need to add any subviews, which we'll refer to as content from now on, to its view hierarchy:

```swift:ViewController.swift
scrollView.addSubview(containerView)
```

As we do to layout and resize any other views in modern `UIKit` code, we will make use of [Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html) constraints to tell the `UIScrollView` which axis it should scroll on and let the `UIScrollView` know what its content size is.

### Understanding a `UIScrollView`'s layout guides

We can define the `UIScrollView`s scroll axis and content size using `NSLayoutConstraints`. To do so, we must make use of its two different content guides:

1. [contentLayoutGuide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscrollview/2865870-contentlayoutguide): This guide can be used to layout the content inside the `UIScrollView`.It will allow the `UIScrollView` to figure out what the content size is and work out when and how much it should allow users to scroll to find content which overflows.
2. [frameLayoutGuide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscrollview/2865772-framelayoutguide): This layout guide provides a set of anchors to pin the subviews to the frame rectangle of the `UIScrollView`, rather than the content frame itself. In other words, if you were to pin your subview's width and height to the `frameLayoutGuide`'s width and height anchors, the content would not scroll at all, no matter how big. The reason for this would be that we would be defining the size of our content (subviews of the `UIScrollView`) relative to the frame of the `UIScrollView`, which should remain constant. What this allows us to do though is to define what the scrollable axis is (i.e. `scrollView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: subView.widthAnchor)` makes your `UIScrollView` only scroll along the Y axis).

Keeping this in mind, let's first to set up the subviews relative to the content guide and define the scroll direction to be along the Y axis:

```swift:ViewController.swift
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
		// Content
		containerView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollView.contentLayoutGuide.topAnchor),
		containerView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollView.contentLayoutGuide.leadingAnchor),
		containerView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollView.contentLayoutGuide.trailingAnchor),
		containerView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollView.contentLayoutGuide.bottomAnchor),
		// Frame - Defines scrolling along the Y axis
		containerView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: scrollView.frameLayoutGuide.widthAnchor),
])
```

If we look at the result now and inspect it with the view debugger, we'll see that while the content scrolls, it seems to not be centred and we get a runtime warning:

![Gif showing the runtime warning and not content in the wrong position](/assets/posts/building-layouts-with-accessibility-in-mind-part-2/runtime-warning.png)

The warning occurs because we have not set a constraint for the content's height, hence the initial height content size is ambiguous. This is a bit tricky because, if we constraint the content's height to the `UIScrollView`'s frame's height, then we'll lose the scrolling and our content will no longer be accessible.

To overcome this issue and allow our content's initial size to be full height (and hence center the content), we can constraint the `containerView`'s height anchor to the `scrollView`'s frame layout's height anchor, but with a priority of `defaultLow`.

This will make sure the content size is not ambiguous and will initially take up the whole of the `UIScrollView`'s frame but, as soon as the `containerView`'s height overflows, it will break the height constraint to the frame layout guide we have set up and make use of the content layout guide constraints instead.

```swift:ViewController.swift
let heightConstraint = scrollView.frameLayoutGuide.heightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: containerView.heightAnchor)
heightConstraint.priority = .defaultLow

NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
		// ...
		heightConstraint
])
```

## The result

That's it! In these two posts, we have built a screen which looks great in the whole range of iOS/iPadOS devices, and respects the user's content size preferences.

Let's take a look at the result:
