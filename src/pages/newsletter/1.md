Hey everyone! 👋 Hope you’ve all had a lovely week and welcome to the first issue of the iOS CI Newsletter 🎉

In these fortnightly issues, I’ll be gathering and sharing content from the iOS community about CI/CD, helping you stay informed and providing you with a lot of learning resources on the topic. And don’t worry, there will also be a CI-inspired meme in every issue! 😂

### [Mobile Devops Summit 2022](https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit/agenda/session/1026320)

What better way to kick us off than a conference on mobile CI/CD and Devops, the [Mobile Devops Summit 2022](https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit/home?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)!

The conference, which is taking place remotely on the 10th of November and is organised by [Bitrise](https://twitter.com/bitrise?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), will have over 80 online sessions from some of the industry’s mobile CI experts.

The conference is free to attend (you just have to [register on the conference’s site](https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit/page/2224546/register?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) and it is a great opportunity for everyone to get together and talk about mobile development and CI.

> ⚠️ Shameless plug alert 😅 - I am giving [a talk at 1 pm](https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit/agenda/session/1026320?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) about how scheduled workflows can help you gain confidence on your release process. My talk will feature some real-world issues iOS developers can face when releasing their applications and how these can be spotted (and fixed) well ahed of time to save you from a stressful release day!

### [Update fastlane on your CI! 🚀](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.210.0)

If you are using [fastlane](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to submit builds to App Store Connect on your CI and have recently updated to Xcode 14 (or you are planning to do so), you’ll want to read this carefully 🕵️‍♂️.

Some of fastlane’s [deliver](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [pilot](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/pilot/?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#pilot) commands no longer work out of the box due to the fact that the [iTMSTransporter command line tool](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/20371?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#issuecomment-1238931528) (used by fastlane under the hood to communicate with App Store Connect) has been removed from Xcode 14.

There are two solutions available to you if you face this issue:

1.  Update fastlane on your CI and benefit from the awesome work [freddi-kit](https://github.com/freddi-kit?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) has made to migrate the critical deliver and pilot commands to use altool instead. 🎉
2.  If the command you need has not yet been migrated, worry not! You can still [download the Transporter app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/transporter/id1450874784?mt=12&utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and use [environment variables to let fastlane know what its path is](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/20371?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#issuecomment-1239093663).

### [Understanding code signing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3125-inside-code-signing-provisioning-profiles)

It is not quite something that has happened in the past couple of weeks, but since this is the first issue, I wanted to share what I think is the best resource to learn and understand the process of code signing.

Apple have dedicated three of their [TechNotes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to do a deep dive into this topic: [TN-3125](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3125-inside-code-signing-provisioning-profiles?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [TN-3126](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3126-inside-code-signing-hashes?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [TN-3127](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3127-inside-code-signing-requirements?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). They have really helped me make sense of the whole process and look at it from a completely different perspective.

### [Collecting project's metrics](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9831667/video/751286701)

As you will know, NSSpain X took place in September and, from what I have heard on Twitter, lived up to all expectations! Even better, for those of us who could not make it this year, the amazing NSSpain crew have made all sessions available on Vimeo, so everyone can watch them 🤟

From all the amazing sessions, I want to highlight [Jessica Hernández Velarde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicahv?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)‘s walkthrough how [Wallapop’s](https://uk.wallapop.com/?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) iOS team gathered data using [Dora metrics](https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/vsm/dora-metrics?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#what-are-DORA-metrics) on their build and deployment process to make informed improvements and decisions, really inspiring and eye opening! 🎉

### [Meme of the week](https://twitter.com/ios_memes/status/1556603881202651136)

I have been setting up new CI workflows for the project I am working on this week and this tweet from [ios\_memes](https://twitter.com/ios_memes?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) pretty much sums up how it’s been going! 😅 

Thankfully I got there in the end…✅
